AB  - This report of the Czech Rarities Committee, working under the Czech Society for Ornithology (CSO), includes records of rare bird species in the Czech Republic submitted for assessment to the Committee in the year 2020 and at the beginning of the year 2021. Altogether 206 records were assessed, of which one was published in the 2019´s report (Vavřík et al. 2020), in five cases additional data were not provided, and three records are related to the observation of subspecies, which will be dealt with by the Committee at its next meeting. Of the 197 resolved records, 159 (81%) were accepted, and 38 (19%) were rejected. Besides that, the report also includes 258 records of species which are subject to registration. In 2020, the Committee was composed of the following members: Jiří Horáček (chair), Jiří Šírek (secretary), Martin Vavřík, David Heyrovský, Robert Doležal, Jan Studecký, Jaroslav Šimek, and Michal Šindel. In 2020, the first record of the Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) in the Czech Republic was made. Furthermore, the second occurrence of the Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors), 2nd and 3rd occurrence of the Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), 3rd occurrence of the Collared Pratincole (Glareola pratincola) and Radde's Warbler (Phylloscopus schwarzi), the first occurrence of the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) since 1950, 5-6th occurrence of the Paddyfield Warbler (Acrocephalus agricola), 6-12th occurrence of the Blyth's Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum), 7th occurrence of the Little Bunting (Emberiza pusilla) and Lappland Longspur (Calcarius lapponicus), 8th occurrence of the Red-rumped Swallow (Cecropis daurica), and 10th occurrence of the Pallas's Leaf Warbler (Phylloscopus proregulus) were recorded. In the following list, numbers in brackets in each species show the number of accepted records before 1988, in the years 1989-2019, and in 2020. Where provided, compound numbers such as n+2 indicate that, besides the accepted records, there is an uncertain number of reports not yet considered by the Committee. A dash (-) instead of a number means that records from the particular period were not collected. An asterisk (*) in front of the species name marks a new species for the fauna of the Czech Republic, “(r)” in front of the species name marks species whose records are only subject to registration. In the species registered since 2008, the number of records in the years 2008-2019 and in 2020 is given in parentheses. The cases when the bird was first found already in the year 2019 and stayed till 2020, and added records from earlier years are shown in italics. We applied the nomenclature of the IOC World Bird List (version 8.2; IOC 2018). The Czech Rarities Committee is a member of the Association of European Records and Rarities Committees (AERC).

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is a typical bird of steppes and agricultural landscapes and mainly occurs in Iberia as well as in southern Russia and Kazakhstan. Due to ploughing of virgin land, intensification of land use and hunting the species has undergone heavy declines in the last century. It is listed as "near threatened" by the IUCN and included in the Red Books of all countries where it occurs. Today there are strong indications that the population in the Eurasian steppe belt has recovered due to outspread of fallows during the transition process of the former Soviet Union. Azerbaijan is well known to be one of the most important wintering grounds for Little Bustards, but detailed and recent information is lacking. This study had the aim to clear up basic questions about the species' wintering sites, its ecology and threats by human influences. The wintering population in Azerbaijan is estimated at more than 150.000 individuals. The results of the fieldwork show that the Little Bustards strongly prefer semi deserts and steppes under winter pasturing and avoid areas of intensive agriculture. They are quite flexible concerning the dominating plant species and the height and cover of vegetation but dependent on large, undisturbed areas. The main threats are disturbances by intensified land use, mainly strong grazing, habitat destruction by raising infrastructure and probably also hunting.

AB  - Animals may perceive humans as a form of predatory threat, a disturbance, triggering behavioral changes together with the activation of physiological stress responses. These adaptive responses may allow individuals to cope with stressful stimuli, but a repeated or long-term exposure to disturbances may have detrimental individual- and population-level effects. We studied the effects of human activities, particularly hunting, on the behavior and physiological status of a near-threatened nongame steppe bird, the little bustard. Using a semiexperimental approach, we compared before, during, and after weekends: 1) the type and intensity of human activities and 2) the behavior and 3) physiological stress (fecal corticosterone metabolites) of wintering birds. Higher rates of human activity, in particular those related to hunting, occurred during weekends and caused indirect disturbance effects on birds. Little bustards spent more time vigilant and flying during weekends, and more time foraging in the mornings after weekend, possibly to compensate for increased energy expenditure during weekends. We also found increased physiological stress levels during weekends, as shown by higher fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Increased corticosterone metabolite levels were associated with the highest levels of hunting-related disturbances. Little bustard showed marked behavioral and physiological (stress hormones) responses to human activities that peaked during weekends, in particular hunting. The long-term effect of this particular activity carried out during weekends from autumn throughout winter might adversely impact wintering populations of this nongame endangered species, potentially counteracting conservation efforts conducted on local as well as foreign breeding populations. © The Author 2014.

AB  - The term "migratory" refers to animals performing yearly round-trips between breeding grounds and post-breeding areas, whereas the term "sedentary" refers to those remaining the whole year in their breeding grounds. However, migration is a complex and varying phenomenon governed by genetic and environmental factors, particularly in species with wide distribution ranges. Here we describe and classify the seasonal movement patterns of 71 little bustards Tetrax tetrax, an endangered Palearctic steppe bird, radio- and satellite-tracked in the Iberian Peninsula. Four major movement patterns were identified, with 89% of little bustards behaving as migrants, among which 75% (summer migrants and summer-winter migrants) performed their first movement after breeding during the summer (mainly between May and July), whereas 14% (winter migrants) left their breeding sites in autumn (mainly between September and November). The remaining 11% were strictly sedentary. On average, summer migration started on June 14th, and winter migration on October 3rd, while pre-breeding migration started on March 23rd. Summer migration occurred in most Iberian regions, although it was mainly found in semiarid Mesomediterranean areas. Winter migration occurred only in the northern half of the Peninsula, being the only pattern found in Subatlantic and highland areas. All winter migrants wintered in Thermomediterranean localities of southern Iberia. The sedentary pattern was found only in the Semiarid Mesomediterranean and Thermomediterranean sectors. This is a good example of complex intraspecific variation in the migratory behaviour of a species that occupies a diverse range of environments. The variability of movement patterns of Iberian little bustards is much greater than previously thought and should be taken into account in conservation programmes for the species.

AB  - Biotic interactions and land uses have been proposed as factors that determine the distribution of the species at local scale. The presence of heterospecifics may modify the habitat selection pattern of the individuals and this may have important implications for the design of effective conservation strategies. However, conservation proposals are often focused on a single flagship or umbrella species taken as representative of an entire assemblage requirements. Our aim is to identify and evaluate the role of coexistence areas at local scale as conservation tools, by using distribution data of two endangered birds, the Little Bustard and the Great Bustard. Presence-only based suitability models for each species were built with MaxEnt using variables of substrate type and topography. Probability maps of habitat suitability for each species were combined to generate a map in which coexistence and exclusive use areas were delimitated. Probabilities of suitable habitat for each species inside coexistence and exclusive areas were compared. As expected, habitat requirements of Little and Great Bustards differed. Coexistence areas presented lower probabilities of habitat suitability than exclusive use ones. We conclude that differences in species' habitat preferences can hinder the efficiency of protected areas with multi-species conservation purposes. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the role of biotic interactions when designing conservation measurements. © 2014 Tarjuelo et al.

AB  - Variations in habitat quality impact on breeding success, leading to strong selection pressure for the best sites to be occupied first during a population increase and last during a decline. Coupled with dispersal and metapopulation processes, the result is that snapshot surveys of wildlife distributions may fail to reveal core areas that conservation seeks to protect. At a local scale, territory occupancy is a good indicator of quality but data are not readily available to assess occupancy for rarer species, in remote areas, and over large spatial extents. We introduce temporal suitability analysis as a way to generate an analogue of occupancy from a single survey and illustrate it using data on the little bustard in Spain. We first used Generalised Additive Modelling (GAM) to build a predictive distribution model using Geographic Information System (GIS) coverages and satellite imagery, and then applied the model retrospectively to a time series of satellite images to produce one distribution map for each year. These annual maps differed in the extent of Spain predicted as suitable for little bustards. By overlaying the maps, we identified areas predicted as suitable in one to n years. We show that this temporal suitability map correlates with a conventional habitat suitability map based on a single year but contains extra information on hierarchical use of habitats and the lag between suitability and use. The technique may be applied at a variety of spatial scales to reveal changes in expected occupancy as land use or external factors determining land cover types vary over time. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Species response to land use can be examined under a functional perspective, where habitats are described according to species´ resource dependencies. Distribution or abundance models based on resource availability rather than land use types can be more informative about the ultimate processes behind observed population or distribution trends. Habitat use may depend on resources available, as well as disturbances that affect accessibility to such resources. Increasing human presence and urban encroachment may thus alter the relationships between habitat suitability and species abundance. Using 10 years of field data, we investigated whether variability in Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) abundance was explained by functional habitat suitability (assessed through resource-based models) and urban encroachment. We found that spatial and temporal variations in Little Bustard abundance were explained by functional habitat suitability and avoidance of urban areas, but that the significance of each variable varied with spatial scale. Little Bustard abundance at each observation point significantly increased with local nesting but not foraging habitat suitability, and decreased with increasing proportion of urban areas. At larger spatial scales, temporal changes in Little Bustard abundance were highly significantly related to changes in foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, the positive relationship between foraging habitat suitability and Little Bustard abundance weakened as the proportion of urban areas increased, and almost disappeared when the proportion of urban areas was more than 5%. Our results underline the benefits of using resource-based models to better understand processes that relate animal abundance and habitat suitability, while simultaneously considering avoided elements of the landscape. © 2022 by the author(s).

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is one of the most threatened steppe bird species in Europe, due mainly to agricultural intensification. Despite the relative importance of the Iberian population (approximately 50% of the global population) little is known about its dynamics and trends, especially in core distribution areas. This study evaluates the influences of meteorological factors and land management on the oscillations and medium-term trends of two Little Bustard populations in Central Spain. During 2001-2007, surveys of breeding male and female Little Bustards were carried out in two central Spanish locations: Valdetorres, in Special Protection Area (SPA) no. 139 (1600 ha), and Campo Real, in Important Bird Area (IBA) no. 075 (1150 ha). Densities were 3.3-4.0 and 1.1-2.1 males/km2 in Campo Real, and 1.8-2.2 and 0.6-1.3 females/km2 in Valdetorres. The sex ratio was biased towards males in both cases. Both populations declined during 2001-2007, especially in Valdetorres (60%). Variation in habitat composition did not explain variation in the numbers of males. Both populations were influenced by total precipitation in the preceding October-May period. Results suggest that the Little Bustard may be sensitive to future climate trends in Europe. Finally, different simulated demographic scenarios suggest that low female survival and productivity may be the immediate cause of the decline in Little Bustard populations, which is consistent with their sensitivity to climatic conditions. © 2009 British Ornithologists' Union.

AB  - Knowledge of feeding ecology of declining species, such as farmland birds, is essential to address their conservation requirements, especially when their habitats are suffering important reductions of trophic resources. In this study, we apply a metabarcoding approach to describe the diet composition of six of the most significant farmland birds inhabiting European cereal pseudo-steppes: little bustard, great bustard, pin-tailed sandgrouse, black-bellied sandgrouse, red-legged partridge, and common quail. We further studied seasonal diet variations (autumn to spring) in all species but the common quail, whose diet was studied during spring and summer. We show that study species´ diets mostly consisted of plants, although in the case of little bustard and great bustard arthropods are also highly relevant. Among arthropods, we found high proportions of thrips, arachnids, and springtails, which were previously unreported in their diet, and some taxa that could be used as antiparasitic food. Moreover, we report that little bustard’s diet is the least rich of that of all studied species, and that diet of all these species is less diverse in winter than in autumn and spring. Diet composition of these declining species supports the importance of natural and semi-natural vegetation and landscape mosaics that can provide a wide variety of arthropods, plants, and seeds all year-round. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article presents the distribution and status of bustards, which are listed as first-category protected animals according to the survey results during 1990-2002 in China. The Chinese populations of Otis tarda dybowskii are breeding in south-west of Heilongjiang Province, western Jilin Province, east and middle Inner Mongolia, north Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province. A few can winter in the south breeding-range. Its winter-range lies from the south to the Yellow River, as far as to Guizhou Province and Jiangxi Province. Its population number is about 200-300 or 500-800. The Chinese populations of O. t. tarda are breeding in the north and west of Xinjiang. It is unclear about its winter-range, which is presumed to be in south Asia. Recently we found individuals wintering in Chabuchaer and west Xinjiang. The population number is about 2000-3000. The habitat in breeding range includes steppe, grassland, desert grassland, and farmland. The habitat in winter range is the beach of rivers and lakes, meadows, meadow-grassland, and wheatland. The Chinese populations of Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni are breeding in the fringe of the Jungar Basin, the banks of the Ulungur River, Balikun and south Turpan Basin in Xinjiang, west Inner Mongolia, and west Gansu. NortheastMulei in eastern Jungar Basin of Xinjiang is the main breeding-range in the world. The bird uses desert and desert grassland as its habitat. Its winter-range is west Asia and south Asia. Its population number is about 2000. The Chinese populations of Tetrax tetrax are breeding in north Xinjiang, and China is located on the east border of its breeding-range. Its habitat is grassland and semi-desert, and its winter-range lies in south Asia. Its population in China is very scarce. In addition, we analyzed the causes of their endangerment and put forward protection tactics of Chinese Bustards. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - The Little Bustard has undergone a steep reduction of its Western Palaearctic range over the last century. In the west of France, breeding populations declined by 96% from 1978 to 2008 in cultivated areas where grasslands have been converted into intensively managed annual crops. Little Bustard abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since 1995 in a 450-km2 site in western France. We assessed the proximate causes of the decline of Little Bustards in French farming landscapes and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to reverse the decline. The decline of Little Bustard, from about 65 males in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than 1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with a higher abundance of grasshoppers. This has contributed to reversing the trend, and increasing the population to around 30 males in 2009. Conservation strategies involving specifically targeted AES based on the identification of limiting factors can help to reverse the decline of threatened species. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Kitchen debris from central Sofia (the 16-18th century A.D.), deposited over the Roman Forum Serdica were examined. They contained 10,375 bone finds of at least 56 animal species: three ray finned fish, 22 birds and 31 mammals. Among them 14 or 82.2% of the identified remains were domesticated forms (birds and mammals). The wild fauna included 42 taxa, from which one globally extinct (Bos primigenius), and four extinct from the recent fauna of Bulgaria (Aegypius monachus, Tetrax tetrax, Falco cherrug, Phasianus colchicus colchicus). Diurnal raptors (A. monachus, Gyps fulvus, Aquila heliaca, A. chrysaetos, Clanga pomarina, Accipiter gentilis, and F. cherrug) made up 60.7% of all wild birds remains. This study presents the first data on subfossil fauna of Sofia City. From a total of 24 (26) species, one is globally extinct, and five other are extinct from the country. Thus, 1/10 of the recorded species are extinct, but they all (except the Aurochs) have survived in the Bulgarian nature until the 20th century. Most of the remains (93.1%) of griffon and cinereous vultures belonged to skeleton of wings, which suggests use by humans of their wing feathers in the past. © 2016 Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research - BAS.

AB  - Elevated temperatures can have a range of fitness impacts, including high metabolic cost of thermoregulation, hence access to microclimate refugia may buffer individuals against exposure to high temperatures. However, studies examining the use of microclimate refugia, remain scarce. We combined high resolution microclimate modelling with GPS tracking data as a novel approach to identify the use and availability of cooler microclimate refugia (sites > 0.5 °C cooler than the surrounding landscape) at the scales experienced by individual animals. 77 little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) were tracked between 2009 and 2019. The 92,685 GPS locations obtained and their surrounding 500 m areas were characterised with hourly temperature and habitat information at 30 m × 30 m and used to determine microclimate refugia availability and use. We found that the semi-natural grassland landscapes used by little bustards have limited availability of cooler microclimate areas—fewer than 30% of the locations. The use of cooler microclimate sites by little bustards increased at higher ambient temperatures, suggesting that individuals actively utilise microclimate refugia in extreme heat conditions. Microclimate refugia availability and use were greater in areas with heterogeneous vegetation cover, and in coastal areas. This study identified the landscape characteristics that provide microclimate opportunities and shelter from extreme heat conditions. Little bustards made greater use of microclimate refugia with increasing temperatures, particularly during the breeding season, when individuals are highly site faithful. This information can help identify areas where populations might be particularly exposed to climate extremes due to a lack of microclimate refugia, and which habitat management measures may buffer populations from expected increased exposure to temperature extremes. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Niche theory predicts that coexisting species will partition resources to limit the effects of interspecific competition. We examined microhabitat partitioning in six sets of steppe birds associated to agroecosystems in central Spain (female and male Great Bustards Otis tarda, female and male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax, Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and Eurasian Stone-curlews Burhinus oedicnemus) to estimate realized niche breadth, overlap and segregation. Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated for each of the PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species' density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e.g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Conservation measures often rely on habitat management, so knowledge about a species’ habitat use is a prerequisite for effective conservation planning. The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a medium-sized bird native to the Palaearctic steppes and today found in extensively farmed habitats, is a threatened species. Its population experienced a 94% decline in farmland habitats in France between 1982 and 1996, and populations all over Europe have suffered equally sharp declines. Due to this steep negative trend, this species has been the subject of a number of habitat selection studies in order to develop relevant conservation measures based on its habitat requirements. In this study, we investigated the habitat selection of a range of habitat types by both sexes and at two nested spatial scales: plot scale and landscape scale. In addition, we analysed intra-specific social interactions by incorporating conspecific density in the statistical models of habitat use. The study was conducted on a very high-density population, perhaps the highest ever recorded for this species at around 50 Bustards per 100 ha of suitable habitat. Our methodology combined two field approaches (point counts and quadrat counts). The findings showed rather limited sexual dimorphism in terms of habitat selection at a local scale, with only vegetation height differing between sexes at a micro-habitat scale, no selection at landscape scale, and a prevailing role of social factors at both scales. The implications for future conservation strategies in relation to population density and landscape composition are discussed. © 2018 British Ornithologists’ Union

AB  - Foraging strategies and diet selection play an essential role in individual survival and reproductive success. The study of feeding ecology becomes crucial when it concerns endangered species such as the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax), whose populations are suffering strong declines as a consequence of agricultural intensification. Despite the fact that several populations are overwintering in areas affected by agricultural transformation, nothing is known about how feeding behavior responds to these changes. We studied for the first time the winter diet composition of the Little Bustard in Spain and compared it between areas with two different farming systems: dry and irrigated farmland. Diet was studied through the micro-histological analysis of 357 droppings collected in 16 locations across the wintering range of the Little Bustard in Spain. Up to 62 plant species were identified. Most consumed species were cultivated legumes (46.7%) and dicotyledon weeds (45.6%), while monocotyledons were scarcely consumed (7.7%). Diet composition differed significantly between dry and irrigated farmland areas. In irrigated areas, diet was mainly composed of legumes, in particular alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In contrast, in dry farmland areas diet was more diverse, composed mainly of weeds (Compositae, Papaveraceae, and Cruciferae) and also cultivated legumes, particularly vetch (Vicia sativa). These results suggest that legume crops could be an effective measure to improve habitat quality in areas with scarce food resources. However, in the case of irrigated areas, the strong reliance on alfalfa could make the Little Bustard more vulnerable to changes in land use. This study is the first step to understand the winter trophic requirements of the endangered Little Bustard, but further research is necessary to understand the food requirements of this species during the entire annual cycle. © 2017 by the author(s).

AB  - In Mediterranean dry grasslands, grazing by domestic animals is an important agricultural activity on dry grasslands. Several bird species occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on the threatened little bustard (Tetrax tetrax L.). The study was conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela, Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of little bustard territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure. Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0.4. LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in ungrazed or heavy grazed fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields, but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly pastures with vegetation height around 20-25. cm. Our results suggest that grazing management plans that aim to conserve little bustard populations should consider (1) the maintenance of the larger long-term pastures and (2) the use of light-moderate stocking rates (0.2-0.6. LU/ha). © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The potential of fallow lands to favor farmland bird conservation is widely recognized. Since fallows provide key resources for birds within the agricultural matrix, such as nesting sites, shelter and forage, complete understanding of the effect of field-management strategies on vegetation structure and food is essential to fulfill bird requirements and improve habitat management. In this study we experimentally compare the most common field practices (ploughing, shredding, herbicide application and cover cropping) on fallow lands by assessing the resources they provide for birds in terms of vegetation structure and food resources (leaf and seed availability), as well as the economic costs of their implementation. Fallow management treatments are ranked for six target species in a lowland area of the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, according to the available information on their requirements. The different agronomic practices offer various quantities and types of resources, highlighting the importance of fallow management in bird conservation. Shredding and early herbicide application (February) are estimated to be good practices for Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and Calandra Lark (Melanocorypha calandra), providing both favorable habitat and foraging conditions, while being economical. Meanwhile, superficial tillage in spring is found to be optimum for the rest of the species tested, despite being among the poorest food providers. Alternating patches of the best treatments would improve the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes by maximizing the harboring habitat for the endangered species. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Changes in land use/land cover are a major driver of biodiversity change in the Mediterranean region. Understanding how animal populations respond to these landscape changes often requires using landscape mosaics as the unit of investigation, but few previous studies have measured both response and explanatory variables at the land mosaic level. Here, we used a "whole-landscape" approach to assess the influence of regional variation in the land cover composition of 81 farmland mosaics (mean area of 2900 ha) on the population density of a threatened bird, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), in southern Portugal. Results showed that ca. 50% of the regional variability in the density of little bustards could be explained by three variables summarising the land cover composition and diversity in the studied mosaics. Little bustard breeding males attained higher population density in land mosaics with a low land cover diversity, with less forests, and dominated by grasslands. Land mosaic composition gradients showed that agricultural intensification was not reflected in a loss of land cover diversity, as in many other regions of Europe. On the contrary, it led to the introduction of new land cover types in homogenous farmland, which increased land cover diversity but reduced overall landscape suitability for the species. Based on these results, the impact of recent land cover changes in Europe on the little bustard populations is evaluated. © 2012 Moreira et al.

AB  - Olive groves in the Mediterranean basin have undergone a tremendous increase during the last two decades, with most of the new olive groves being planted on arable land. This conversion may affect habitat suitability for steppe birds, which are associated with arable land and other open-land habitats, such as natural pastures. In this work, we evaluate the presence of new olive groves in the distribution of the Great Bustard Otis tarda and the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax in Southern Spain (the largest olive oil production zone in the world), and we compare the percentage of different land uses in 2000 and 2018 using data provided by the Corine Land Cover. From 2000 to 2018, new olive groves occupied 2.14 and 2.61% of the distribution areas of the Great Bustard and the Little Bustard, respectively. The decrease in arable land and the increase in permanent crops were the main drivers of the landscape composition changes during the study period. The fragmentation index of arable land was higher in 2018 than 2000. These changes in the landscape suggest a decrease in habitat availability and suitability for steppe birds that could affect the distribution and abundance of their populations. Moreover, there were no differences in the proportion of new olive groves planted inside and outside the limits of Important Bird Areas (IBAs) from 2000 to 2018, which were created to protect these steppe birds, thus suggesting that the management policy of the IBAs should be reviewed to prevent harmful land-use changes.  ©

AB  - The problem of preserving the bio-diversity is also facing the field crop regions. In the present case, the preservation of the Little Bustard's habitat led to the setting-up, under contracts, of perennial grass swards in the Champeigne tourangelle, a cereal-growing region. For the past fifteen years or so, the farmers in that region (in the Indre-et-Loire département) have been made aware of environmental issues and have subscribed to various contracts. The creation of the 'Natura 2000' zone however necessitated difficult discussions, here presented, that eventually brought about a specific MAET 'Territorial Measure for the Farm Environment', locally managed by the authorities, the farmers, the hunters and the environmentalists. During 2010, 6% of the area of the Natura 2000 zone will be under contracts, with setting-up of Lucerne and/or Tall Fescue swards. © 2010 Association Francaise pour la Production Fourragere.

AB  - Behavioural ecology has a key role to play for improving wildlife conservation. Behavioural studies applied to animal conservation are increasingly frequent, although research at the intersection of both research disciplines has still potential for further development. We briefly review some of the benefits of the interplay between both disciplines, focusing on human disturbances, and illustrate them using two case studies on steppe-birds of conservation concern. We first highlight the benefits of combining measures of behaviour and physiological stress to assess the potential adverse effects of adverse effects of human activities on little bustards and pin-tailed sandgrouse wintering in central Spain. We show how human activities (particularly hunting) increase the time spent flying, the size of wintering flocks, the levels of stress hormones and foraging behaviour after the disturbances. We highlight that creation of hunt-free reserves with good feeding habitats should minimize the negative effects of disturbances. In the second case study, we look at how human disturbances through nest visits visits may have had long-term effects on the phenotypic composition, in terms of behavioural personality types, of a population of Montagus harrier monitored over 20 years. Behavioural responses to nest visits, which are necessary to protect nestlings from mortality during cereal harvesting, define female personalities (bold vs shy). Disturbance during nest visits induce breeding failure in shy but not in bold females, leading to a population compositional change with an increasing proportion of bold females in monitored populations. We highlight the importance of behavioural studies aimed at conservation problems, particularly in a context where human activities are increasing in space and time. © 2017 Los Autores.

AB  - Populations of the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax in the farmlands of Europe have declined greatly over the last century. In Western Europe, France now holds the only remaining migratory population, which currently numbers fewer than 300 displaying males. However, the movements of these birds are virtually unknown, in spite of the important implications of this information for the conservation of this species. We identified migratory movements and overwintering areas of French migratory populations, using wild individuals fitted with satellite or radio-transmitters. Little Bustards completed their migration journey over a relatively short time period (2-5 days), with nocturnal migration flights of 400-600 km per night. All birds overwintered in Iberia. In addition, we tested the consequences of captive rearing on migratory movements. French wild adults and French captive-bred juveniles behaved similarly with regard to migration, suggesting that hand-raising does not alter migratory movements. However, birds originating from eggs collected in Spain and reared in western France did not migrate, suggesting a genetic component to migratory behaviour. These results therefore suggest that a conservation strategy involving the release in France of birds hatched from eggs collected in Spain may imperil the expression of migratory movements of the French population. More generally, to maintain the integrity of native populations, the introduced individuals should mimic their migratory movements and behaviour. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Developing a standardized survey methodology to census and estimate the size of wintering populations is a main conservation priority for the endangered Little Bustard. We present a standard and repeatable methodology to census wintering Little Bustard populations at a regional scale, and the first statistically reliable population estimate of a Little Bustard wintering population in Spain. We carried out two surveys, in 2003 and 2004, using UTM 10 km 6 10 km squares as census units, which were subjected to stratified sampling over the species' potential distribution range in the region of Madrid (Central Spain). Only the areas of potentially suitable habitat within squares of known winter presence of the species were considered. The species' winter distribution in Madrid was fairly constant between years, showing a fragmented pattern in three main nuclei. The number of Little Bustards observed was consistent between surveys (752 and 786 birds, respectively), with birds grouped in an average of 32 flocks (1 to 350 birds, mean 5 27.9 birds). No between-winter differences in flock size were observed, although differences between sectors were significant. The highest densities were observed in the Tagus valley (mean density 5 2.9 birds km-2, 293 birds), followed by north-eastern farmland (mean density 5 0.6 bird km-2, 269 birds). The estimated size of the Little Bustard population wintering in the Madrid region was 1,051 (95% CI 5 1,043-1,231). This calculation was based on recorded population density, measured as the number of birds per square kilometre, and considers the potential habitats available in each sector. We propose this methodology as adequate for surveying any Little Bustard wintering area, at both regional and smaller spatial scales. Survey results are consistent with previous tentative estimates for the region of Madrid, and with available information on Little Bustard movements. Sixty-five per cent of squares with Little Bustard presence were outside any protected area, which makes the wintering Little Bustard population of Madrid highly vulnerable to habitat disappearance and may affect the viability of breeding nuclei whose individuals winter in the region. © BirdLife International 2007.

AB  - Even though leks have been widely used by biologists as a model to study sexual selection, we still do not understand how lekking individuals use space, interact and socially progress over time. This study aimed to provide new insights into lekking breeding dynamics using a high temporal and spatial resolution data set derived from the GPS tracking of adult male little bustards, Tetrax tetrax, collected over a 4-year period. We found the lekking system was dynamic at both intra- and interseasonal scales. Smaller ranges were consistent with territorial behaviour. Using Bayesian latent cluster analysis, based on the movements of each individual, we were able to distinguish between breeding behavioural modes, territorial and floating, within the breeding season. Surprisingly, only 27% of the males were found to be constantly territorial within the same year. The remaining birds showed predominantly floating behaviour or shifted between the two behavioural modes, floating and territorial, possibly indicating male turnover. Birds that were tracked for more than 1 year tended to return to the same breeding range. Floating males between years reduced their ranges within the same area and became territorial, indicating a trend for rank progression with increasing adult age. The combination of territorial site fidelity and male rank ascent based on age can explain the temporal persistence of leks within stable habitats. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - Heat stress is a risk for birds exposed to high ambient temperatures, especially for those that live in open environments with limited protection from direct sun radiation. This makes them particularly vulnerable to climate warming. We studied how ambient temperature affects the daily activity of a threatened grassland bird, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax. The activity of 20 birds tracked by GPS satellite telemetry between 2009 and 2012 was monitored throughout the yearly cycle in the Iberian Peninsula. We found that temperatures over;258C strongly inhibited the activity of birds during the breeding and post-breeding seasons. High temperatures were mostly frequent during mid-day, which often forced birds to reduce activity during this period, especially during summer. We show that the expected future rise in temperatures may result in a substantial reduction in the duration of the period of the day thermally adequate for maintaining activity. With climate change inactivity levels during breeding and post-breeding are expected to rise 37% and 59%, respectivly, compared to present standards. This may pose serious time constraints, particularly on functions like breeding and foraging, with potential consequences for individual fitness and population dynamics. Global warming may thus affect the range of birds not just through habitat change but also by limiting their activity. 2015 Silva et al.

AB  - In Iberian cereal-steppes, decoupling of payments from current production levels through the Single Farm Payment raised concerns regarding the potential for land abandonment and replacement of sheep by cattle, with eventual negative consequences for declining grassland birds. This study addressed this issue by analysing the responses of five grassland bird species of conservation concern to spatial land use gradients, which are expected to reflect changes potentially associated with the CAP reform. Our results show that both habitat fragmentation and grazing regimes were major drivers of breeding bird densities, though responses to these factors were species-specific. Thekla larks were most abundant in landscapes with small grassland patches and high edge density, whereas calandra larks were abundant only in large expanses of continuous open farmland habitat. Little bustard and short-toed lark densities declined in highly fragmented landscapes, but they appeared to tolerate or even benefit from low to moderate levels of open habitat fragmentation. Corn buntings were little affected by landscape patterns. At the field scale, little bustard and corn bunting densities were highest in fields grazed by cattle, whereas short-toed larks were mostly associated with sheep pastures. Short-toed larks and Thekla larks were most abundant in old fallow fields where cattle was largely absent, whereas corn buntings showed the inverse pattern. These results confirm the view that the same agricultural policies may be favourable for some species of conservation concern but detrimental to others, and so they cannot be assumed to bring uniform conservation benefits. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adult sex ratios (ASRs) have proved to correlate with population trends, which make them potential useful indicators of a species' population trajectory and conservation status. We analysed ASRs and proportion of juveniles in flocks of an endangered steppe bird, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, using surveys made during the non-breeding period in seven areas within its Western European range (one in Portugal, four in Spain, and two in France). We found overall male-biased ASRs, as all the seven surveyed areas showed a male-biased ASR mean value. Five areas were below the threshold median value (female sex ratio = 0.4) considered to be consistent with an increased probability of extinction, according to earlier population viability analyses for the species. We also found a significant positive correlation between female ratio and the proportion of young individuals in the non-breeding flocks surveyed. Our results (strongly male-biased ASRs) support the hypothesis that the viability of Little Bustard populations in Western Europe is threatened by an excess of female mortality, something that should be quantified in the future, and emphasise the value of monitoring sex ratio as a population viability indicator in species where monitoring survival is difficult to achieve.  © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Arable agriculture is the principal form of land use in Europe, occupying nearly 30% of the land area. While much of this is farmed very intensively, there are arable systems of high value to wildlife where cropping is diverse and interstitial habitats such as hedges, lines of trees, grassland patches and ponds are present. Arable farming practices have changed greatly since the end of the nineteenth century, and particularly rapidly since the 1940s. These changes have included improvements to seed purity, the introduction of herbicides for control of non-crop plants, large increases in the application rates of fertilisers together with the development of high-yielding crop varieties and the ever-increasing size of farm machinery causing the removal of field boundary habitats. In recent years, irrigation has become more widespread, ploughing has been replaced by minimum cultivation and there has been an overall homogenisation of arable land. While these processes have been slower in the south and east of Europe, all countries are now affected. These changes have had profound impacts on farmland wildlife through the direct and indirect effects and the loss of heterogeneity. These have included the catastrophic population declines of farmland birds such as corn bunting, little bustard and grey partridge, the loss of many formerly widespread plants characteristic of arable land, and declines of invertebrate numbers and diversity. The rising demand for food to supply an increasing global population is the main driver of agricultural production. A slowing population growth and increasing agricultural efficiency may reduce pressures on arable land, while better understanding of the environmental costs of agricultural intensification coupled with payments to farmers will provide incentives to reduce inputs and mitigate their impacts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The bonnacon, an animal described in the medieval bestiary, when pursued by hunters, squirts a cloud of boiling dung at them, wounding both dogs and men. Another bestiary animal, the onager, also used its dung in a deceptive way to avoid pursuit. These defensive tactics can be related to similar tactics reported in medieval sources for two birds, the grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) when attacked by hunters’ falcons. Was the fabled defensive behaviour of the bonnacon transferred to a completely different species when passing through the medium of experti, huntsmen, foresters and falconers, where the actions of animals were observed but not correctly interpreted as to cause and effect? This paper traces the bonnacon in late medieval history and studies the apparent portability of its defensive behaviour among different species. © The Society for the History of Natural History.

AB  - We investigated population productivity and habitat selection of the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax in the late breeding period, in grassland-dominated landscapes of south-west Iberia. Specifically, our goals were to investigate how these parameters are influenced by the management of (1) grazing and (2) hay production. We conducted bird counts from 22 June to 4 July (2012 to 2016) using low speed 4x4 car surveys. The relationship between the density of the species, population productivity and farm management (grazing and haying) was evaluated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Male and female densities were significantly higher in short vegetation compared to all other types of vegetation considered, but population productivity was similar in short and medium vegetation. Hay stubbles were found to be unattractive for the species. The availability of suitable habitats depends on the timing of grazing, notably of seasonal (spring) grazing. Species density was higher in fields ungrazed during winter and with moderate to high stocking rates in spring (around 0.8 LU/ha or higher), depending, at least for males and females, on each year's weather characteristics. We conclude that low to moderate stocking rates during winter and spring are essential to ensure successful breeding and thus population persistence. Current levels of haying in our study area are detrimental for the species' conservation. Copyright © BirdLife International 2017.

AB  - In the face of the dramatic worldwide decline of farmland bird populations, the preservation of fallow fields is a conservation measure encouraged through subsidies (e.g. agri-environmental schemes, AES). Beyond the general benefits of increasing fallow availability for endangered steppe bird populations, there is a lack of knowledge on how fallow management can contribute to meeting species-specific habitat requirements. We used occurrence data from three steppe bird species protected at the EU level (Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra), framed in a quasi-experimental approach covering an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale that included 612 fallow fields over a 3-year study period in an agricultural Mediterranean landscape (Spain). We used path analysis to explore the mechanisms by which common agricultural practices affected species-specific occurrence. We examined partial effects of agricultural practices on vegetation structure and food availability, and the partial effect of these variables on bird occurrence compared to control fields (no agricultural practices applied). Agricultural practices had a significant effect on the presence of the three studied species. Through changes in the vegetation structure, Shredding + Herbicide and Tillage increased the occurrence of the Stone Curlew and Shredding increased the occurrence of the Little Bustard. The occurrence of Calandra Lark was mostly affected by landscape variables. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights that, in addition to the acknowledged positive role of fallow availability, applying a limited number of specific agricultural practices before the breeding season can further increase bird occurrence by changing the vegetation structure. Using path analysis, we explored the mechanisms driving the occurrence of three steppe bird species under different agricultural practices. Such information is key to providing specific recommendations for future conservation management of endangered species within agri-environmental schemes. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The influence of arthropod availability on the formation of male little bustard breeding territories in central Spain was studied in two consecutive years. Arthropods (68,217 individuals) were sampled using pitfall trapping and male territories estimated by means of kernel functions. Hymenopterans (ants), beetles, mites and spiders were the main taxa found in the samples, while the highest contributions in terms of biomass came from hymenopterans, beetles and orthopterans. The only group that exhibited significant biomass differences between territory and non-territory locations was that of the beetles; this pattern was consistent between years. Carabidae was the main beetle family in terms of biomass, followed by other large beetles such as Tenebrionidae, Cleridae, Scarabeidae and Elateridae. The biomass of Carabidae that were larger than 15 mm was significantly higher within territories than outside them. The biomass of Cleridae was greater in fallows, while Elateridae were more abundant in arable fields. The total biomass of beetles that were larger than 15 mm was higher in arable fields than in fallows. Family richness differed between years, while diversity showed differences between agricultural fields (it was highest in fallows), although these variables did not differ between territory and non-territory locations. Results indicate that large beetles (particularly carabids) seem to be a valuable food resource that is defended by little bustard males during the highly energy-demanding breeding season, which is discussed here in relation to habitat selection, the mating system and its implications for the conservation of the species. © 2007 The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of conspecific abundance and habitat quality of leks on the territorial behaviour of males in an exploded lekking species, the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax). The hypothesis that males more intensely defend territories with higher conspecific abundance and better habitat quality was evaluated experimentally analysing the agonistic response of experimental males to male decoys placed on their displaying areas. Decoy experiments showed that the intensity of display territory defence by little bustard males is density dependent. The time experimental males took to return to their display sites after decoy placement decreased with abundance of both males and females. The strength of their final response was positively associated to local male and female abundance in the vicinity of their display sites. Habitat quality also influenced males' display territory defence since the intensity of male response increased with the degree of natural vegetation cover. Habitat quality was particularly relevant in explaining variation of experimental males' snort call rate, which decreased with the degree in plough cover and increased with the number of fields in the lekking area. Snort call rate decreased with the level of male aggregation and was lowest in males exhibiting the strongest aggressive response to decoys. These results add new evidence for the density dependence of species' breeding territorial behaviour, supporting density-dependent models of lek formation and reinforcing the role of resources defence in exploded lek mating systems. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Collision with conductors and earth cables is a known impact generated by transmission power lines, however there is virtually no information on how these infrastructures might affect bird distribution in a landscape context. With this work we specifically hypothesise that transmission power lines may affect the occurrence of a threatened bird, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax). To test this hypothesis we used a Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM), analysing the effects of power lines in a landscape perspective and simulating population trends as a response to power line installation and habitat changes induced by agricultural shifts in southern Portugal. The data used in the dynamic model construction included relevant gradients of environmental conditions and was sampled during the breeding seasons of 2003-2006. Transmission power lines were significantly avoided by the little bustard and the developed StDM model showed that the distance to these utility structures is the most important factor determining breeding densities in sites with suitable habitat for the species, which possibly leads to displacement of populations and habitat fragmentation. The model simulations also provided the base to analyse the cumulative effects caused by the habitat degradation that can ultimately lead to the extinction of local populations. Within priority conservation sites, the dismantling of existing transmission lines should be considered whenever possible, in order to ensure adequate breeding habitat. The model is considered useful as an auxiliary tool to be used in environmental impact assessments, management and conservation studies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract—Based on the count data obtained by various methods and their statistical processing, the abundance of the fall population of the little bustard in the Saratov Trans-Volga region was estimated from the late 1990s until the present. From 2012 to 2016 it averaged about 30 000 individuals, whereas in the Volga right bank region it was one or two orders lower and the species distribution there was sporadic. When studying the T. tetrax abundance dynamics, an increase in its population in the studied territory in the first half of the 2000s was established. The necessity of carrying out census work in the future for monitoring the population is substantiated. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - We examined sexual differences in patterns of vegetation structure selection in the sexually dimorphic little bustard. Differences in vegetation structure between male, female and non-used locations during reproduction were examined and used to build a presence/absence model for each sex. Ten variables were measured in each location, extracting two PCA factors (PC1: a visibility-shelter gradient; PC2: a gradient in food availability) used as response variables in GLM explanatory models. Both factors significantly differed between female, male and control locations. Neither study site nor phenology was significant. Logistic regression was used to model male and female presence/absence. Female presence was positively associated to cover of ground by vegetation litter, as well as overall vegetation cover, and negatively to vegetation density over 30 cm above ground. Male presence was positively related to litter cover and short vegetation and negatively to vegetation density over 30 cm above ground. Models showed good global performance and robustness. Female microhabitat selection and distribution seems to be related to the balance between shelter and visibility for surveillance. Male microhabitat selection would be related mainly to the need of conspicuousness for courtship. Accessibility to food resources seems to be equally important for both sexes. Differences suggest ecological sexual segregation resulting from different ecological constraints. These are the first detailed results on vegetation structure selection in both male and female little bustards, and are useful in designing management measures addressing vegetation structure irrespective of landscape composition. Similar microhabitat approaches can be applied to manage the habitat of many declining farmland birds. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most species-climate models relate range margins to long-term mean climate but lack mechanistic understanding of the ecological or demographic processes underlying the climate response. We examined the case of a climatically limited edge-of-range population of a medium-sized grassland bird, for which climate responses may involve a behavioural trade-off between temperature stress and reproduction. We hypothesised that temperature will be a limiting factor for the conspicuous, male snort-call display behaviour, and high temperatures would reduce the display activity of male birds. Using remote tracking technology with tri-axial accelerometers we classified and studied the display behaviour of 17 free-ranging male little bustards, Tetrax tetrax, at 5 sites in the Iberian Peninsula. Display behaviour was related to temperature using two classes of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) at different temporal resolutions. GAMMs showed that temperature, time of the day and Julian date explained variation in display behaviour within the day, with birds snort-calling significantly less during higher temperatures. We also showed that variation in daily snort-call activity was related to average daytime temperatures, with our model predicting an average decrease in daytime snort-call display activity of up to 10.4% for the temperature increases projected by 2100 in this region due to global warming. For lekking birds and mammals undertaking energetically-costly displays in a warming climate, reduced display behaviour could impact inter- and intra-sex mating behaviour interactions through sexual selection and mate choice mechanisms, with possible consequences on mating and reproductive success. The study provides a reproducible example for how accelerometer data can be used to answer research questions with important conservation inferences related to the impacts of climate change on a range of taxonomic groups. © 2019 Gudka et al.

AB  - With the combination of worldwide landscape changes and the uncertainty about the impact on species abundance and distribution, the value of spatio-temporal modelling tools is increasingly obvious. The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax breeds on low-intensity arable cultivation and pastoral land and is currently threatened by diverse landscape modifications. The aim of this research was to predict Little Bustard population trends in the face of realistic scenarios of land use and infrastructure changes, applying a recently developed spatially explicit framework, based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM). The application of this approach provided some basis to analyse the responses of breeding populations' spatial distribution and abundance to the scenarios implemented. Since some of these scenarios represent local and/or regional risks to the viability of Little Bustard breeding populations, the results obtained demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework for landscape planning in the scope of the conservation of this threatened species. This approach also provides a promising baseline to support ecological risk assessments for other species, derived from ecological models with increased predictive power and intuitiveness to decision makers and environmental managers.

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax (Linnaeus, 1758) is a medium-sized, 'Near Threatened' steppe bird, whose Iberian population has been alarmingly declining over recent decades. Although this population loss has been mainly attributed to agricultural intensification, there is no information on Little Bustard adult mortality levels and their drivers. Based on a joint effort combining all the tracking data on adult Little Bustards collected over a period of 12 years by all research teams working with the species in Iberia, we found that annual anthropogenic mortality is likely to have a critical impact on the species, with values almost as high as the mortality attributed to predation. Collision with power lines was found to be the main anthropogenic threat to the adult population (3.4-3.8%/year), followed by illegal killing (2.4-3%/year), which had a higher impact than initially foreseen. Our work shows how poorly understood and previously unknown threats are affecting the survival of the most important Little Bustard population in Europe. Copyright © BirdLife International 2017.

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is an iconic species and an indicator of healthy grassland and farmland ecosystems. It formerly ranged almost continuously from north-western Africa and Iberia to central Asia, encompassing France, Italy, southern Russia, and the Middle East, occupying natural grass steppes, pastured grasslands, and extensive cereal farmland. Today, two main distribution sub-ranges persist: a western one comprising the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Sardinia, and an eastern one encompassing mainly southern Russia and Kazakhstan but reaching north-western China and isolated spots in Turkey. We describe the changes that occurred across the species' range and were documented during the last and current centuries and revise the status and trends of Little Bustard populations throughout that range. We provide the first global estimate of the world population, as well as those of the two sub-ranges, discussing the main threats and global conservation implications of these estimates. Historically abundant in Europe and northern Africa, the Little Bustard has strongly declined over the second half of the 20th century, becoming extinct in at least 15 countries. Such spectacular regression is mainly associated with land-use change and agricultural intensification. Other threats are legal hunting, poaching, and collision with powerlines. In the last two decades, the species has severely declined (c.6% yearly rate) in its traditional population stronghold, the Iberian Peninsula. Conversely, there is evidence of recent population growth in some areas of the Eastern range, but increases are unquantified and require further study. Many populations are probably small and scattered, with no reliable information on size and trends. Nevertheless, the Eastern range may now be considered the species' stronghold with more than half the world's population. The diverging dynamics and ecological differences between the two sub-ranges require a global conservation strategy that treats each as a different conservation unit to assure the species' recovery.  ©

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) gained recently some visibility in the Mediterranean region. By affecting soil and plant ecology, CA is expected to influence other biological groups, notably farmland birds. This study aims to assess (1) the importance of tillage regime (conventional vs. no-tillage) and frequency of cultivation under these two regimes in determining the richness and abundance of birds in extensive grasslands originated within rotational cropping systems, and (2) how tillage systems contribute to changes in bird richness and abundance, comparatively to other drivers of bird ecology in Mediterranean farmland. We conducted bird censuses (point counts) from 2012 to 2016 in 34–52 fields per year of 15 farms in Évora region (Southern Portugal). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to link bird abundance/richness with agricultural descriptors. Both tillage regime and cultivation frequency showed weak effects on Species richness and Total bird abundance. However, a strong variability in the response to tillage descriptors was found between species. For the little bustard and the Iberian grey shrike, a strong interaction with the annual weather regime and opposite trends for the effect of tillage regime were detected. Despite its moderate influence on bird assemblages comparatively to other major drivers of bird richness and abundance (i.e. grazing and annual weather regime), CA could constitute a potential complementary “greening measure” to manage extensive grasslands within rotational cropping systems, particularly in areas where soil erosion is a problem, although some species may not benefit from its implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The dynamics of a population of little bustards in the northern steppe Trans-Urals is considered. After a period of almost complete absence in the 1970s and 1980s, since the early 1990s, temporarily vacant parts of the range have been inhabited again and an increase in the population has been observed. By the beginning of the 21st century, the little bustard had almost regained its former habitat in the region. By the end of the 1990s, the average population density in the agricultural landscape reached 1 ind./km2. By the end of the first decade of the 2000s, it exceeded 2 ind./km2. In recent years, the little bustard has rarely been observed in steppe pastures but is found more frequently on perennial grass crops and harvested grain fields, while the bulk of its population (up to 70–80% of all couples) inhabits fallow lands, the appearance and preservation of which is associated with the steady reduction in agricultural production in the last two decades. © 2014, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Migratory decisions, such as the selection of stopover sites, are critical for the success of post-breeding migratory movements and subsequent survival. Recent advances in bio-logging have revealed the stopover strategies of many long-distance migrants, but far less attention has been given to short-distance migrants. We investigated the stopover ecology of an endangered grassland bird, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a short-distance migrant in Iberia. Using high-resolution spatial GPS/GSM data, 27 male Little Bustards breeding in southern Portugal were tracked between 2009 and 2011. We studied post-breeding movements using Dynamic Brownian Bridge models to identify the main stopover sites, and generalized linear mixed models to examine habitat selection in stopovers. During their post-breeding movements, males were essentially nocturnal migrants, making frequent stopovers while maintaining a relatively fast pace to reach more productive agricultural post-breeding areas. Stopovers occurred in most post-breeding movements (83%) regardless of the total distance covered (average 64.3 km), and most stopovers (84%) lasted less than 24 h. Birds used mostly agricultural non-irrigated and irrigated croplands as stopover sites and avoided other land uses and rugged terrain. There was a negative relationship between stopovers and the proximity to roads, but not to power lines. The high frequency of stopovers during post-breeding movements, despite the short distances travelled, together with the nocturnal migratory behaviour of bustards, may impose additional risks to a bird mainly threatened by collision with power lines in non-breeding areas. We also conclude that even for short-distance migrants, habitat connectivity between breeding and post-breeding areas is likely to be a key conservation concern. © 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union

AB  - Farmland landscapes in developed countries have undergone major habitat changes over the past 60 years leading to the decline of many species. Of these, the little bustard, a medium-sized, long-lived, ground nesting bird, has declined by 95% in France over the last 35 years. Here we present the results of a 21 year survey of the nesting ecology of this elusive species, analyzing 157 breeding attempts, the largest data set ever collated for this species. Females had a strong preference for meadows for breeding, yet this habitat only represented 14% overall habitat. Alfalfa alone accounted for 50% of nest locations. However, apart from vegetation type, females did not show any other pattern of habitat selection (vegetation height, nest position within field, field under agri-environmental contract-AES-). In addition, the laying period was extremely extended, spanning almost 3 months. We did not detect any strong effect of crop, date or whether the nesting field was in AES or not, on clutch size, egg size and egg-laying date. However, there were long-term changes in breeding phenology (females breed earlier than 20 years ago), and selection of vegetation between years and within years. Hatching success was very low (about half of the broods were destroyed by farm work), and both fecundity and productivity per female were found to be approximately one third of the values expected for a stable population. Overall, nesting females of Little Bustards select meadows in regard to their availability, but do not show any particular preference within meadows' vegetation structure or height. We show that in such system, meadows act as ecological traps, and furthermore, because females do not appear selective, it is impossible to manage meadows in order to limit this trap. We finally analyze whether the land-sharing AESs can conserve this species in intensive arable systems and conclude that the land sharing may not be sustainable. We discuss our results in light of the alternative of land sparing, and suggest that this is probably a better fit for the conservation of large-bodied bird species given their ecological constraints (large home ranges, presence of semi-natural landscape components and freedom from human interference). © 2018

AB  - The little bustard Tetrax tetrax (Aves, Gruiformes) is a threatened bird species, which is highly reliant on extensively grazed semi-natural grasslands. It is one of the more rapidly declining species in Europe due to the widespread intensification of agricultural practices and consequent abandonment of agro-pastoral activities. Therefore, understanding its habitat requirements in different seasons is crucial to implement adequate habitat management measures. Previous knowledge of habitat preference of the little bustard in Sardinia, which nowadays supports the only remnant isolated population present in Italy, is only available for the breeding season. We conducted surveys of displaying males in spring and of mixed flocks (of different age and sex classes) in summer and quantified habitat requirements in the two seasons using logistic regression analysis. Overall, we detected 85 displaying males in spring and seven mixed flocks (totalling 77 individuals) in summer within the study area. Interestingly, habitat preference models evidenced contrasting needs between the two different seasons: Males occurrence in spring was higher with greater fallow cover and further from water, whereas in summer flock occurrence was negatively related to fallow cover. This seasonal change in fallow preference is likely due to the effect of grazing livestock on this land-use. Extensive grazing is known to shape adequate habitat structure for displaying males in spring. On the other hand, grazing animals in summer may deplete the already limited food resources (i.e. green plants) available during this dry period of the year and when energy requirement for the little bustard is high due to feather moulting. This may explain the observed avoidance of fallow cover in summer. Conservation efforts in Sardinia should aim at maintaining a mosaic of diverse habitats that may provide complementary resources at any given time of the year that would benefit this and other grassland species of conservation concern. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

AB  - Grassland birds are among the most threatened and fastest declining terrestrial vertebrate species in Europe, principally due to agricultural intensification and transformation. The little bustard is a priority grassland bird under the European Directive (2009/147/CE) that led to the classification of a network of Special Protected Areas (SPAs) in Portugal. A third national survey carried out in 2022 reveals a worsening of an ongoing population collapse at a national scale. The population declined by 77% and 56% compared to the previous surveys in 2006 and 2016, respectively. We found that the little bustard has greatly disappeared outside SPAs, while the remaining breeding population concentrated within the protected area network is showing a steep decline at a rate of 9% a year. This decline is now twice as fast when compared to the period 2006–2016. Analysis of the variation of the breeding densities between 2006 and 2022 at 49 survey sites revealed that those that initially had higher bustard densities and shifted toward a higher proportion of cattle among the total stocking rate experienced steeper declines. Areas where the density of roads increased also experienced declines over the course of the study period. Agricultural areas converted to or dominated by beef production likely relate to low breeding success and mortality of nesting females in fodder crops. Still, major habitat conversion outside SPAs to permanent crops led to overall habitat destruction, which contributed to the species decline and range contraction. Other threats are likely acting synergistically such as fragmentation, climate change and anthropogenic mortality. The extinction of the little bustard in Portugal is expected in the short term if no conservation actions are put in place. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Positive interactions between species can have important conservation implications, especially when the species associating are both vulnerable. We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses Pterocles alchata and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65% of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred stubble fields and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of pin-tailed sandgrouse depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used stubble fields significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that pin-tailed sandgrouse benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (stubble fields) that would otherwise be too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Collision with power lines is a major cause of mortality for many bird species. Understanding the biotic and abiotic factors that increase collision risk is therefore important for implementing mitigation measures to minimize mortality, such as power line rerouting or wire marking. Here, we used collision events registered during 2003-2015 along 280 km of transmission power lines in southern Portugal to analyse spatio-temporal patterns and collision risk factors in two sympatric, threatened, and collision-prone species: the great bustard Otis tarda and the little bustard Tetrax tetrax. The occurrence of collisions was not uniform across space and time, and variations could be explained by the species' ecological requirements, distribution patterns and behaviour. Although both species fly considerable distances between areas of suitable habitat, collisions were far more likely in power line sections with > 20% (for the little bustard) or > 50% (for the great bustard) of open farmland habitat in the surroundings. Power line configuration was also important: taller pylons and those with a higher number of wire levels posed a higher risk for both species. Wire marking had a small but significant effect for the little bustard, reducing collisions risk. There was, however, no similar effect for the great bustard, possibly a result of limited data. Mitigation measures should be implemented to prevent bustard collisions, including adequate route planning, ideally avoiding areas with > 20% of open habitat. Line configuration and wire marking are particularly important where such localities cannot be avoided and power lines cross areas with a high proportion of bustard habitat, including outside protected areas.

AB  - The Little Bustard is suffering a widespread population decline mainly due to agricultural intensification. This study evaluates the effects of intensification level, habitat availability and rainfall on the population dynamics of this species. The population density of males was monitored for 7 years (2002-2008) at 184 points located within three sites with contrasting levels of agricultural intensification in southern Portugal. Densities decreased along the intensification gradient from 8.2 to 2.3 males/km2. Overall, there was an approximately 50% population decline during the period 2002-2008, driven by a decline observed in one of the less intensive sites, whereas in the other two sites densities remained fairly constant. Yearly variations in male densities were influenced by intensification level, amount of grassland habitat and rainfall patterns. Thus, agricultural intensification is having a negative effect on population densities of this threatened species, particularly through the loss of grasslands (fallow fields and pastures) suitable for displaying males. The results also suggest a positive impact of rainfall on male densities, although this is more likely in grasslands within less intensive agricultural regions of poorer soil quality, where higher breeding male densities occur. Grassland habitat quality, driven by both climate and human management, probably plays a major role in the population dynamics of this threatened steppe bird in its strongholds. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise is spreading worldwide and can interfere with the acoustic communication of multiple animal groups. Species communicating in low-frequency ranges (having large sound production structures) and with limited vocal learning are expected to be especially vulnerable to human noise-induced masking interference. Yet how such species may confront this emerging impact has scarcely been explored. Here we examined the effect of anthropogenic noise on the calling behaviour of a sizeable non-passerine bird, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, across a gradient of road traffic noise and in relation to male position within the lek. Using directional recordings and noise mapping, we determined inter- and intra-individual variation in call parameters and their relationship with noise level and frequency at both spatial and temporal scales, defined respectively as (i) variation of noise according to the position of the calling sites of each male within the lek (spatial scale) and (ii) fine temporal variation of noise experienced by individual males immediately prior to each call (temporal scale). Little Bustard males increased their call rate at sites exposed to higher average noise levels and at those located further from the nearest neighbour within the lek, whereas temporal changes in noise showed no effect on call rate. In contrast, call duration decreased with relative increases in noise level prior to each call, being unaffected by spatial changes in noise. Peak call frequency showed no significant variation over time and among sites. Our findings reveal that, despite its supposedly limited vocal learning, this species seems to exhibit fine-scale vocal adjustment, which implies some capacity to cope with anthropogenic noise. However, the lack of frequency shift suggests behavioural constraints that may compromise communication as the species uses low-pitched calls. This study provides insights into how some non-passerine birds may adjust their vocal sexual display to anthropogenic noise. - Barrero, A., Llusia, D., Traba, J., Iglesias-Merchan, C. & Morales, M.B.

AB  - The effects of habitat fragmentation on species may change seasonally mainly due to variations in resource availability and biotic interactions. In critical periods, such as winter, when the importance of intraspecific competition diminish, species may relax their environmental requirements widening their ecological niche to exploit the scarcer trophic resources more efficiently in comparison with spring. Those variations in niche width may implicate seasonal expansions/retractions in species distribution. In this sense, an integrated knowledge on the spatial arrangement of breeding and wintering suitable patches is essential to infer seasonal movements (migratory connectivity). This paper shows that little bustard environmental preferences were more predictable and complex (controlled by a larger number of environmental factors) in spring than in winter, when potential distribution and ecological niche width were slightly larger. In spring, habitat variables (i.e. percentage of dry crops and pasturelands and altitude) ruled species' distribution; while, winter pattern was driven by mixed criteria, based on both habitat and climate (i.e. percentage of dry crops and wastelands and winter rainfall). Suitable patches were more connected across spatial scales in winter than in spring, i.e. landscape was perceived as less fragmented. The overlap between potential breeding and wintering distribution areas was high. In fact, most of the predicted wintering areas coincided or showed high connectedness with predicted breeding patches. Conversely, there were significant breeding patches that were predicted with low suitability, showing little connectedness with potential winter areas. Spring habitat was a better predictor of little bustard's wintering range than vice versa, which has clear management implications (preserving breeding sites closer to wintering areas ensures the conservation of a larger proportion of the total distribution range). This is an example of how predictive large-scale modeling procedures can contribute to the optimization of land management aimed at species conservation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2010-2016, we monitored 28 clutches of eight adult Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax females tracked by GPS on the Lleida Plain, in the Ebro Depression (NE Spain), to study nesting and incubation behaviour. In addition to describing these behaviours, we used generalised linear mixed models to identify the factors that determine hatching probability, such as laying date, nesting habitat and incubation behaviour. We found a high capacity (53%) to produce replacement clutches following nest failure. Unsuccessful nests represented 67.9% of clutches, mainly due to the low hatching rate of replacement clutches (16.7%) but also of the first clutches (44%). The main causes of failure were nest abandonment or predation (58%), while farming practices were responsible for 38.9% of failures. We found an increased risk of failure due to desertion or predation towards the end of the incubation. The risk of failure was higher in late clutches, although this seemed to be directly related to cereal mowing and to changes in nesting substrate, from cereal to alfalfa, which occurred throughout the breeding season. Likewise, we found a negative effect of the size of the field where the nest was found and of the surrounding habitat on the hatching probability, which we related to the availability of food for the female in these fields. Measures aimed at improving food provision, by increasing field edge density and fallow availability, would help to maintain hens in good condition prior to and during incubation, as well as providing suitable habitat for replacement clutches. Adaptive irrigation and mowing patterns in alfalfa fields during the nesting season could contribute to increasing the hatching success of replacement clutches. - Cuscó, F., Bota, G., Llovet, A. & Mañosa, S.

AB  - This paper describes a survey of the birds in Moldova Region (Romania) in the present day. Its focus is on ecological information and distribution, as well as on rare and endangered species. As well as providing information for ecologists, the survey will contribute to future archaeozoological work in the Moldova Region, where the bird fauna of the past is still not well known. During 2008-2012, we set up a monitoring programme that aimed to estimate the diversity of bird species. To build a complete database for Moldavian bird species, it was necessary to make observations in the different habitat types: wetlands, anthropogenic areas, pastures, orchards and forest ecosystems. As a result of this programme, compared with 1837, when Cihac reported over 200 species of birds, now there are now an estimated 284 species. The increased number of species recorded in the Moldova Region is due to the enrichment of ornithological information on the one hand and on the other hand to the higher number of ornithologists who are doing research in the field. Some species have expanded their distribution further north (e.g. long-legged buzzard), but the unequivocal climate change, the drastic changes of habitat and changed agricultural policies have all led to the extinction of species such as the great bustard, little bustard, vultures and others. The main factors that affect the bird populations at a local level in this region are the changes in the agricultural and forestry policies, the changes in weather-related parameters that have a deep impact on habitats but also the lack of ecological education of the population. Unlike in other similar regions, in Moldova, human impact has had a very low influence on the distribution of bird species, but we cannot say the same for bird numbers that have declined in recent years. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Mediterranean pastures are experiencing strong changes in management, involving shifts from sheep to cattle-based livestock systems. The impacts of such shifts on biodiversity are still poorly understood. Here, we sought to contrast the grazing regime, vegetation structure, bird species richness and abundance, between sheep and cattle grazed parcels, to understand the mechanisms through which management decisions impact farmland birds. During spring 2019, we characterized livestock management, bird populations and sward structure in 23 cattle and 27 sheep grazed parcels. We used a Structural Equation Model to infer the direct and indirect effects of sheep and cattle grazing on birds. Although no effects were found on overall species richness, there were species-specific responses to sheep and cattle grazed systems. Grazing pressure (variable integrating stocking rate and the number of days in the parcel) had negative impacts on the prevalence/abundance of Zitting Cisticola, Corn Bunting and Little Bustard, either directly or indirectly, through the effects of grazing pressure on vegetation height. Animal density and vegetation cover had direct positive effects in Galerida spp. and Common Quail, respectively. Zitting Cisticola and Little Bustard also showed a direct response to livestock type. Our study emphasizes the importance of grazing pressure as a driver of negative impacts for bird populations in Mediterranean grasslands. Since the ongoing transition from sheep to cattle-based systems involves increases in stocking rate, and therefore potentially higher grazing pressure, we propose a policy change to cap the maximum allowed grazing pressure. At the landscape scale, a mix of sheep and cattle grazed fields would be beneficial for maintaining bird diversity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The Lleida plain is a flat and dry region in Western Catalonia (NE Spain), at the eastern edge of the Ebro Valley depression. The central part of the area is now devoted to intensively irrigated farmland, but a surrounding belt of steppe and pseudo-steppe and low intensity farming, mainly occupied by winter cereal, olive trees and almond trees, remains. The area still hosts a rich community of steppe land birds. Some are dependent on low intensity dry cereal farming and fallow, such as the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and calandra lark (Melanocorypha calandra). Other, such as the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata) and black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) inhabit the few remaining large spots of fallow land, while the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti) and lesser short-toed lark (Alaudala rufescens) are both associated to the remaining patches of natural steppes or halophytic vegetation. The greater short-toed lark (Calandrella brachydactyla) and the European thick-knee (Burhinus oedicnemus) favour areas of little disturbed wastelands, fallow or ploughed land. Although more generalist, the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) or the European roller (Coracias garrulus) also find in these low intensity farming areas one of their last strongholds in Catalonia. The single remaining Iberian population of lesser grey shrike (Lanius minor), on the verge of extinction, is also located within these steppes. All these species experienced severe population declines during the last decade of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first. Strong opposition to the Segarra-Garrigues irrigation system, launched at the start of the twenty-first century and aiming to transform most of the remaining steppes of the Lleida plain into intensified irrigated crops, has boosted many conservation actions, which are reversing or halting the negative trends for some of these species. These actions include, among others, the declaration of eight Special Protection Areas (SPAs), the renting or acquisition and management of steppe-land and fallow land, the provision of nesting sites, the implementation of breeding programs to reintroduce or reinforce some populations, or the mitigation of power lines to reduce collision risk. Although there is room for some optimism, the persisting intensification of agriculture outside and inside the SPAs, and the industrial and urban development of the area are still of great concern. We need a change in the rural development concept, from one that values only economic services to one that values social and ecological services as well, if we want some room for steppe-land birds in the Lleida plain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - European grassland birds are experiencing major population declines, mainly due to changes in farmland management. We analyzed the role of habitat availability, grazing management and linear infrastructures (roads and power lines) in explaining spatial and temporal variation in the population density of little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) in Portugal, during a decade in which the species population size halved. We used data from 51 areas (totaling ca. 1,50,000 ha) that were sampled in two different periods (2003–2006 and 2016). In 2003–2006, when the species occurred at high densities, habitat availability was the only factor affecting spatial variation in bustard density. In the 2016 survey, variation in density was explained by habitat availability and livestock management, with reduced bird numbers in areas with higher proportions of cattle. Population declines across the study period were steeper in areas that initially held higher densities of bustards and in areas with a higher proportion of cattle in the total stocking rate. Areas with higher densities of power lines also registered greater density declines, probably due to avoidance behavior and to increased mortality. Overall, our results show little bustards are currently lacking high quality grassland habitat, whose persistence depends on extensive grazing regimes and low linear infrastructure densities. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of the Protected Area networks on the conservation status of target species. Here, we assess the effectiveness of the Portuguese Natura 2000 (the European Union network of protected areas) in maintaining a species included in the Annex I of the Bird Directive, namely the population of a priority farmland bird, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax. Methods. We measured the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 by comparing population trends across time (2003-2006 and 2016) in 51 areas, 21 of which within 12 Special Protection Areas (SPA) that were mostly designated for farmland bird conservation and another 30 areas without EU protection. Results. Overall, the national population is estimated to have declined 49% over the last 10-14 years. This loss was found to be proportionally larger outside SPA (64% decline) compared to losses within SPA (25% decline). However, the absolute male density decline was significantly larger within SPA . Discussion. In spite of holding higher population densities and having prevented habitat loss, we conclude that Natura 2000 was not effective in buffering against the overall bustard population decline. Results show that the mere designation of SPA in farmland is not enough to secure species populations and has to be combined with agricultural policies and investment to maintain not only habitat availability but also habitat quality. © 2018 Silva et al.

AB  - Farmland biodiversity is declining worldwide, and especially in Western countries largely owing to the large-scale intensification of agricultural practices. The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is a steppe bird adapted to agro-pastoral ecosystems in Western Europe, and is one of those many farmland species declining due to changes in agricultural production systems. In the EU, the majority of the extant population of this species is concentrated in the Iberian Peninsula. In Italy, the species has now disappeared from the mainland and is currently present only in Sardinia, where two populations, in the central-western areas, hold about two-thirds of the whole island's numbers, with the rest scattered across numerous smaller nuclei. While there are indications and anecdotal information suggesting a possible population decline during recent decades, robust monitoring across different time periods that would allow a comparison of numbers is lacking in Sardinia. Here we repeated a Little Bustard survey performed in 2008 in two areas of western Sardinia: Abbasanta, which is one of the two strongholds for the species in Sardinia, and Campeda, which holds a small population (about 10 territorial males). Using the same methodology as in the past survey, we assessed current population size and density, and quantified changes over time. We found alarming declines, at a rate of around 30% in 14 years in both areas, with an estimated current population of 87 males in Abbasanta and 8 males in Campeda. We highlight current and emerging threats, such as the downsizing of the Special Protection Area of Abbasanta, and the encroachment of solar power plants within the same area.  © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - The little bustard Tetrax tetrax has undergone severe range contraction within Europe due to abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities. Previous studies of habitat selection have mainly focused on extensive cereal and cropland mosaics, while the species' ecology in pastoral landscapes is understood less well, and data are completely lacking from the Sardinian population. We conducted distance sampling surveys of displaying males across three contrasting landscapes in Sardinia and modelled habitat preference at both the landscape and local (within pastures and recent fallows) scale. Abbasanta, with a balance of pasture and cropland, the greatest isolation from roads and shortest vegetation, supported the highest little bustard densities (95%CI 2.7-3.4 males/100 ha). Significantly lower densities were found in two landscapes with lower isolation from roads and taller vegetation within grasslands: Campeda (0.1-0.2 males/100 ha), comprising cropland and pasture in similar proportions to those found at Abbasanta, and Campidano (0.3-0.4 males/100 ha) that was dominated by cereal agriculture. At the landscape level, males preferred pastures and recent fallows over arable lands. At the local scale, within grasslands, probability of occurrence was greater with shorter vegetation, more legume and green herb cover and at points remote from roads. Shorter vegetation in grasslands resulted from high grazing pressure, and habitat suitability for breeding males depends strongly on extensively grazed grasslands. Conservation efforts for this species should focus on maintaining traditional agro-pastoral practices which maintain large areas of extensively grazed pastures and recent fallows located far from roads. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Capsule Set-aside (land temporally removed from agricultural production) features and their regional locations influence steppe-bird species of conservation concern in Catalonia. Aims To identify set-aside features important to the ecology of four ground nesting species, namely Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Greater Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra. Methods Set-aside fields were surveyed in four regions of Catalonia (northeast of Spain) for the selected species during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. Set-aside habitat descriptors (e.g. size, vegetation structure) were collected. Ordination plots and information theoretic methods were used to assess the relationship between the selected bird species, set-aside features and the regions. Results The region where the set-aside was located had a strong effect on the abundance of the selected species. In addition, vegetation coverage, field shape of set-aside and surrounding natural habitats were critical features, but with contrasting effects on the different species. Conclusion Populations of the selected species of conservation concern could be improved by effective management of set-aside. As selected species responded differently, we recommend that management at local level should take into account the conservation value at a regional level of the protected area for each of the selected species. © 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - Effective solutions for integrating development of agriculture and conservation of biodiversity at a landscape scale remain to be identified. This article presents a case study on an intensively farmed French cereal plain, where the reintroduction of grasslands has been proposed to protect the Little Bustard, a threatened European bird species. Although this solution may seem trivial at first glance, we analyze the design reasoning from which it resulted in order to highlight the innovative paths it opened. We apply C-K theory, a design theory that distinguishes concepts (i.e., unknown proposals) from knowledge. Our analysis reveals the links between the production of scientific knowledge and the generation of various solutions. It also highlights that specifying the ecological functions of grasslands facilitates their management. In the cereal plain, some of these functions give grasslands the status of common goods. This consideration opens new possibilities for managing agricultural landscapes in a way that reconcile agriculture and conservation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Identifying the factors that affect ranging behavior of animals is a central issue to ecology and an essential tool for designing effective conservation policies. This knowledge provides the information needed to predict the consequences of land-use change on species habitat use, especially in areas subject to major habitat transformations, such as agricultural landscapes. We evaluate inter-individual variation relative to environmental predictors and spatial constraints in limiting ranging behavior of female little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) in the non-breeding season. Our analyses were based on 11 females tracked with GPS during 5 years in northeastern Spain. We conducted deviance partitioning analyses based on different sets of generalized linear mixed models constructed with environmental variables and spatial filters obtained by eigenvector mapping, while controlling for temporal and inter-individual variation. Results: The occurrence probability of female little bustards in response to environmental variables and spatial filters within the non-breeding range exhibited inter-individual consistency. Pure spatial factors and joint spatial-habitat factors explained most of the variance in the models. Spatial predictors representing aggregation patterns at ~ 18 km and 3-5 km respectively had a high importance in female occurrence. However, pure habitat effects were also identified. Terrain slope, alfalfa, corn stubble and irrigated cereal stubble availability were the variables that most contributed to environmental models. Overall, models revealed a non-linear negative effect of slope and positive effects of intermediate values of alfalfa and corn stubble availability. High levels of cereal stubble in irrigated land and roads had also a positive effect on occurrence at the population level. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that female little bustard ranging behavior was spatially constrained beyond environmental variables during the non-breeding season. This pattern may result from different not mutually exclusive processes, such as cost-benefit balances of animal movement, configurational heterogeneity of environment or from high site fidelity and conspecific attraction. Measures aimed at keeping alfalfa availability and habitat heterogeneity in open landscapes and flat terrains, in safe places close to breeding grounds, could contribute to protect little bustard populations during the non-breeding season. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Farmland biodiversity is in alarming decline worldwide due to agriculture intensification. In this context, the umbrella species concept may help in better targeting conservation efforts, focusing on species whose requirements may best cover those of other components of biological communities. We test this idea using the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), a strongly declining steppe bird depending on extensive agricultural landscapes of south-western Europe, to explore the degree to which its habitat requirements can predict those of other sympatric endangered steppe birds. We use little bustard and other nine species distribution data at 10 × 10 km scale in Castilla-La Mancha (the most important region for the little bustard in Spain and the EU) and habitat favourability models to identify variables explaining little bustard favourability that can robustly predict habitat favourability also for the other nine species. Models fitted with variables explaining little bustard favourability and applied on co-occurring species yielded varying performance results. Models support the role of the little bustard as umbrella species only for a part of the steppe bird community, and more precisely, for species linked to cereal and grassland-dominated landscapes, but not for landscape generalist species, distributed over mosaic landscapes including shrublands and woody crops. Results also highlight the importance of favourable extensive cereal steppes for the conservation of strongly endangered species (little and great bustard, Montagu’s harrier, pin-tailed sandgrouse, calandra lark), some of which are largely understudied (pin-tailed sandgrouse and calandra lark), despite their marginal coverage by the Natura 2000 protected area network. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Species distribution patterns are determined not only by habitat preferences but also by biotic factors. Particularly, the presence of conspecifics may yield different types of benefits and costs for the individuals involved. This study analyses the spatial distribution of Little Bustard families during the breeding season in relation to the distribution of male core areas in three Spanish populations of the species. A compositional analysis is used to evaluate habitat selection and the habitat types most preferred by females with offspring. Spatial analyses were performed to evaluate the proximity of Little Bustard families to male core areas and male displaying sites. The habitat selection pattern was similar between regions, with semi-permanent vegetation and stubbles as most preferred habitats while others, such as ploughed land, were avoided. Families were located closer to male core areas than expected by chance and were spatially associated to male displaying sites. Little Bustard females may obtain different benefits from this spatial association such as access to more food resources and chances for second matings after a clutch loss. Also in stubbles, the capture of prey by chicks would be easier and semi-permanent habitats would serve as shelter. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific interactions in the definition of the habitat selection pattern of females and families. This study shows how spatial point pattern analysis may be a useful tool for integrating landscape and behavioural ecology.

AB  - We describe the use of different agricultural habitat types by little bustard females nesting and rearing young chicks, based on observations gathered over a five-year period (2001-2005) in central Spain. The frequency of occurrence of nest or family locations within male lekking territories is also evaluated, as well as their association to habitat types preferred by females for nesting or chick rearing. A total of 28 nesting or brood locations (19 nests plus 9 families) were recorded over the study period. Habitat use did not differ significantly between nesting females and families. Both for the total sample (nests plus families) and the only-nests sample, the frequency of recorded locations differed between agricultural habitat types, with long-term fallows (older than two years) being the most frequently used. Young fallows (1-2 years old) were significantly more frequently used than cultivated habitats and ploughed-fields together, but less than long-term fallows in both samples. Nest plus family locations were more frequently found within estimated male territories than outside. Both in the total and the only-nests samples, locations within territories were found only in long-term and young fallows, the former being the most frequently used habitat type. These results from a mosaic cereal landscape provide further support to the role of long-term fallows as a critical habitat for breeding female little bustards found in other, more extensive, study areas, and reinforce the role of young fallows as an alternative breeding habitat when the former are absent or unsuitable. The strong dependence of breeding little bustards on fallows highlights the need to maintain their vegetation structure suitable as nesting and chick rearing habitats in order to prevent the species' current population decline in Spain.

AB  - Previous studies have found that densities of little bustard Tetrax tetrax breeding males tend to be higher in areas with smaller agricultural fields, presumably due to increased habitat diversity. However, exceptionally high densities have been found in large grassland fields in Portugal, which suggests that the influence of field size varies geographically, and that the role of this factor is not yet fully understood, despite its importance as a key management issue.We studied how field size, together with vegetation structure, influences the presence and density of breeding little bustards in a region of southern Portugal. Fifty-four grassland fields were sampled in 2007 and another 29 in 2008, with sizes ranging from 23 to 172. ha. A total of 183 breeding males were found in 47 of these fields, reaching densities of up to 37 males/100. ha. A higher probability of occurrence of breeding males was found in larger fields with a vegetation height below 40. cm and field size alone explained 46% of the variability in male density. These results suggest that larger continuous areas of suitable habitat attract many males, most likely as a consequence of their lek mating system. We conclude that conservation efforts, in a landscape context of large farm sizes, should: (1) be channelled to farms with large fields; (2) ensure adequate livestock grazing to create suitable habitat and (3) promote management at a landscape level to ensure the most continuous grassland habitat patches possible. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Farmland bird populations have strongly declined across Europe over the last decades due to agriculture intensification, despite successive reforms of EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In parallel, CAP has led to a reduction of fallow land, a critical habitat for biodiversity in agroecosystems. Fallow land in Spain, a country harboring the largest European populations of many endangered farmland birds, has decreased by 1.1 million ha in 15 years. The significant positive relationship between yearly change rates of the Spanish Farmland and Cereal Bird Indices (FBI and CBI) and fallow surface change highlights the adequacy of fallow land cover as an indicator of the state of farmland bird communities at country level. Moreover, the strong and positive association between the reduction in abundance of the fallow specialist little bustard and fallow surface suggests a potential causal link between these two factors. These results highlight the need for a new CAP that guarantees the maintenance of fallow land in European agroecosystems if farmland bird populations are to be conserved. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Agriculture intensification threatens farmland bird populations because, among other reasons, it reduces the availability of food resources required to rear their offspring. In our study, we sampled and analyzed total arthropod abundance, biomass and richness, and orthopteran and coleopteran abundance and biomass in different agricultural habitats (alfalfa fields, stubble fields, grazed fields, and field margins) across 4 study localities with different levels of agriculture abandonment–intensification, comparing between areas used and not used by one of the most threatened farmland birds in Europe, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), during the chick-rearing season. Field margins were the taxonomically richest habitat, while alfalfa fields presented significantly higher total arthropod abundance and biomass than other habitats. All arthropod variables were the highest in the localities with clear conservation-focused agrarian management, and the lowest in the most intensive one. Areas used by little bustards had higher orthopteran and coleopteran abundance and biomass than nonused areas, except for coleopteran biomass in grazed fields. These results highlight the relevance of these arthropods for the species, the importance of dry alfalfa fields as food reservoirs in this critical time of year, the food scarcity in sites where agrarian management disregards farmland bird conservation, and the role of stubbles as providers of food resources during the chick-rearing season in areas used by the species. The adequate management of alfalfa fields and stubbles to provide those key resources seems crucial to improve little bustard breeding success. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is a Near Threatened grassland bird that is fully migratory within its eastern population, wintering in large numbers across the south Caucasus and northern parts of Iran. The species' habitat selection has been comprehensively studied in its western European range, but very limited information is available for its eastern population. Surveys carried out between 2010 and 2015 show a considerable population increase and probable range expansion in the region. We modelled the suitability of potential winter habitat for the species and found that distance to country border, land cover and altitude were the most important variables in predicting habitat suitability. There is still considerable hunting pressure in Iran and distance to border is likely to be related to strict hunting prohibition along the border belt imposed for military purposes. This represents an opportunity for the conservation of the species, where management efforts should aim at ensuring the maintenance of suitable land cover. Copyright © BirdLife International 2017.

AB  - The release of farm-reared game birds for hunting is an increasingly common game management practice. However, releasing could have negative effects on sympatric wild species, for example, through parasite transmission. Here, we document the spatial-temporal patterns and intensity of red-legged partridge releases in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain, over a 15-year period (2002–2016), relating them to local changes in the abundance of little bustards estimated from two surveys carried out in 2005 and 2016. Within the province, > 600,000 red-legged partridges were released annually over at least 20% of the area. Releasing intensity varied between estates and fluctuated over the 15-year study period, probably because of an economic crisis during 2008–2014. Overall, numbers of little bustards dropped by 46% between surveys, the decrease being more marked in the west of the province. Contrary to expectation, the only hunting estates where little bustards did not decrease were those with higher release intensity. This may be a consequence of management measures or other factors that benefit little bustards and are more prevalent on those estates than elsewhere, such as game crop provision, predator control or habitat quality. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Most research on steppe bird habitat selection has been focused on the effects of management regimes or vegetation structure. However, much less is known on how plant composition is related with steppe bird occurrence. We investigated microhabitat of little bustard territorial males and females during the nesting and chick-rearing season in areas with dominance of pastureland focusing on plant composition. We searched for relationships between preferred vegetation and arthropod abundance in order to identify the contribution of different vegetation typologies in providing essential trophic resources for the species. Surveys of little bustards were made using car and foot transects. Plant composition was obtained within a 50 × 50 cm square at four sampling replicates and arthropod availability was sampled using a sweep net. Statistical procedures were conducted in three steps: (1) analysis of variance was used to identify at univariate level the plant composition and arthropod variables that were significantly related with both male and female occurrence sites; (2) principal components analysis was performed using the variables with significant results at univariate level; (3) model averaging on generalized linear and mixed models was applied to evaluate the selection probability of each principal component. The species occurs in sites with high floristic richness and high abundance of Fabaceae species, although plant composition differs from male to female sites. These variables were found to be crucial to provide higher abundances of arthropods, notably of Acrididea, Formicidae and some groups of Coleoptera which are decisive for the selection of displaying or female breeding sites. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Summary In conservation biology, population monitoring is a critical step, particularly for endangered groups, such as steppe birds in European agro-ecosystems. Long-term population monitoring allows for determination of species population trends and also provides insights into the relative roles that environmental variability and human activities have on priority species. Here, we compare the population trends of two sympatric, closely related farmland bird species, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax and Great Bustard Otis tarda, in a protected area of Central Spain, which is their main stronghold in Europe. Over 12 years of monitoring, the abundance of Little and Great Bustards shifted in opposite directions in our study area. Little Bustard abundance decreased significantly (both males [-56%], and harder-to-detect females [-55%]), while Great Bustard abundance increased significantly (1,800%). Future surveys should be more precise and frequent for Little Bustards to facilitate evaluation of their population status and trends. We recommend annual surveys in 2-3 important locations by region throughout the breeding range for Little Bustards, while for Great Bustard the current regional monitoring programmes would be sufficient. © BirdLife International 2018.

AB  - The little bustard Tetrax tetrax is a threatened grassland bird highly reliant on agro-ecosystems for survival. Understanding its habitat requirements throughout its yearly cycle is essential to promoting adequate management practices. A late summer, post-breeding habitat selection study was conducted at three sites located in Alentejo, in the south of Portugal. Overall, 48 flocks were counted. A highly-significant explanatory logistic model demonstrated that little bustard post-breeding sightings primarily occur in locations with greater food availability, adequate vegetation height, and more productive soils. Fallow land and areas grazed by sheep tend to be avoided. Additionally, the species abundance was estimated at 18 sites distributed among the specie's main range in Portugal, covering 67,000 ha and 971 km of car transects. Another 119 flocks were registered. Surprisingly, hardly any birds were found at priority breeding sites. Overall, the data suggest that important breeding populations of the little bustard dependent upon extensive agriculture within Iberia (generally where soils are less productive), are likely to depend on other areas with greater food availability during the dry summer season. Maintaining suitability of the habitat near important breeding areas with more productive soils could prevent further species movement in search of foraging areas and diminish mortality risk. At these sites, conservation efforts should focus on maintaining the landscape open and ensure the dominance of low intensity land uses with short vegetation, such as cereal stubbles or certain legume crops. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interspecific competition is a dominant force in animal communities that induces niche shifts in ecological and evolutionary time. If competition occurs, niche expansion can be expected when the competitor disappears because resources previously inaccessible due to competitive constraints can then be exploited (i.e., ecological release). Here, we aimed to determine the potential effects of interspecific competition between the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) and the great bustard (Otis tarda) using a multidimensional niche approach with habitat distribution data. We explored whether the degree of niche overlap between the species was a density-dependent function of interspecific competition. We then looked for evidences of ecological release by comparing measures of niche breadth and position of the little bustard between allopatric and sympatric situations. Furthermore, we evaluated whether niche shifts could depend not only on the presence of great bustard but also on the density of little and great bustards. The habitat niches of these bustard species partially overlapped when co-occurring, but we found no relationship between degree of overlap and great bustard density. In the presence of the competitor, little bustard's niche was displaced toward increased use of the species' primary habitat. Little bustard's niche breadth decreased proportionally with great bustard density in sympatric sites, in consistence with theory. Overall, our results suggest that density-dependent variation in little bustard's niche is the outcome of interspecific competition with the great bustard. The use of computational tools like kernel density estimators to obtain multidimensional niches should bring novel insights on how species' ecological niches behave under the effects of interspecific competition in ecological communities. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is one of Europe's most threatened birds, and depends mostly on extensive agricultural and pastoral schemes for survival. Due to the female's secretive behaviour, information concerning female breeding ecology is scarce and restricted to sites with some level of agricultural intensification. Consequently, most advice for improving the habitat for this species is based on male habitat needs alone. The breeding season encompasses three distinct biological phases for females-visiting lekking males, nesting, and brood-rearing-which are likely to result in different habitat requirements. In northern Alentejo (Portugal), we studied how female densities vary during the breeding season and analysed their habitat preferences at different scales during the three phases. Both female and male density varied during the season. Local and regional female densities of 16 and 7.6 females/100 ha, respectively, are among the highest ever recorded for the species. The results of a binary GLM suggest a greater probability for the occurrence of nests in larger grassland fields with a vegetation height under 42 cm. Nests were also located preferentially in the proximity of displaying males. Female micro habitat requirements varied significantly throughout the breeding season. Vegetation heterogeneity in larger grassland fields is likely to play an important role in providing adequate habitat for females throughout the whole breeding season. Large grassland fields should, therefore, constitute a management priority in key breeding sites for the species. © 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

AB  - In response to climate changes that have occurred during Pleistocene glacial cycles, taxa associated to steppe vegetation might have followed a pattern of historical evolution in which isolation and fragmentation of populations occurred during the short interglacials and expansion events occurred during the long glacial periods, in contrast to the pattern described for temperate species. Here, we use molecular genetic data to evaluate this idea in a steppe bird with Palaearctic distribution, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax). Overall, extremely low genetic diversity and differentiation was observed among eight little bustard populations distributed in Spain and France. Mismatch distribution analyses showed that most little bustard populations expanded during cooling periods previous to, and just after, the last interglacial period (127,000-111,000. years before present), when steppe habitats were widespread across Europe. Coalescent-based methods suggested that glacial expansions have resulted in substantial admixture in Western Europe due to the existence of different interglacial refugia. Our results are consistent with a model of evolution and genetic consequences of Pleistocene cycles with low between-population genetic differentiation as a result of short-term isolation periods during interglacials and long-term exchange during glacial periods. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In order for competing species to coexist, segregation on some ecological niche component is required and is often mediated by differential habitat use. When unequal competitors are involved, the dominant species tends to displace the subordinate one to its less preferred habitat. Here, we use habitat isodars, an approach which reflects evolutionary stable strategies of habitat selection, to evaluate whether interspecific competition between two competing species with distinct habitat preferences, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax and the great bustard Otis tarda, modulates their habitat use. Field data on these endangered species demonstrate that unequal competitors can coexist without completely segregating on their preferred habitats. The negatively sloped isodar of the subordinate little bustard unveils its competition with the dominant great bustard. Interference from great bustards in secondary cereal habitats reinforces use of preferred natural habitat by little bustards. Studies of density-dependent habitat selection by a single-species can thus aid in identifying the effects of competition on community composition, and guide the conservation of at-risk species. Isodars, in particular, represent a promising method to gain clear knowledge on interspecific competition for species in which experimental manipulations are not feasible. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Afforestation often causes direct habitat losses for farmland birds of conservation concern, but it is uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and >300 m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of calandra larks and short-toed larks, but not of little bustards and tawny pipits. Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Populations of Houbara Bustards have dramatically declined in recent years. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have had limited success in reviving population numbers and thus new technological solutions involving molecular methods are essential for the long term survival of this species. In this study, we sequenced the 694 bp segment of COI gene of the four specimens of Asian Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). We also compared these sequences with earlier published barcodes of 11 individuals comprising different families of the orders Gruiformes, Ciconiiformes, Podicipediformes and Crocodylia (out group). The pair-wise sequence comparison showed a total of 254 variable sites across all the 15 sequences from different taxa. Three of the four specimens of Houbara Bustard had an identical sequence of COI gene and one individual showed a single nucleotide difference (G > A transition at position 83). Within the bustard family (Otididae), comparison among the three species (Asian Houbara Bustard, Great Bustard (Otis tarda) and the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax)), representing three different genera, showed 116 variable sites. For another family (Rallidae), the intra-family variable sites among the individuals of four different genera were found to be 146. The COI genetic distances among the 15 individuals varied from 0.000 to 0.431. Phylogenetic analysis using 619 bp nucleotide segment of COI clearly discriminated all the species representing different genera, families and orders. All the four specimens of Houbara Bustard formed a single clade and are clearly separated from other two individuals of the same family (Otis tarda and Tetrax tetrax). The nucleotide sequence of partial segment of COI gene effectively discriminated the closely related species. This is the first study reporting the barcodes of Houbara Bustard and would be helpful in future molecular studies, particularly for the conservation of this threatened bird in Saudi Arabia. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Little bustard populations have suffered reduction and isolation as a consequence of landscape transformations resulting from changes in traditional agricultural systems. Consequently, the species survives within reduced and fragmentary habitats, like islands isolated in a modified matrix. In this paper, we analyze the spatial variations in male density and habitat quality in a fragmented population located at the limit of the species' Iberian range, which is affected by agricultural intensification, using a regional modelling approach. Habitat quality (quantified according to the species perception) and bird density decreased along the intensification gradient. However, in the most intensive agricultural zone, the quality of habitats selected by little bustard males increased, while density decreased, against the expected. In possible explanation, we suggest: (1) density is not necessarily a good indicator of habitat quality, (2) population could be under-saturated in this zone, (3) interannual variations in species distribution, or (4) other relevant variables related to the agricultural intensification process not included in this analysis, such as small-scale disturbances. Analysis of population distribution pattern showed a spatial configuration in which the most densely populated squares were located at the core of the biggest population patches, in contact with mid-density squares, and all surrounded by low-density squares. Fragmentation negatively affected habitat quality and male density. Largest population patches, containing higher density values, were located at the beginning of the intensification gradient. Preservation of little bustard densities is related to an adequate management of the farming system. Habitat fragmentation requires an urgent conservation strategy to prevent local and regional scale habitat deterioration, by reducing patch isolation to maintain genetic diversification and functional connectivity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In their choice of mates, females may use alternative tactics, including a comparative assessment of males in a population, using one or several relative preference criteria. Traits involved in female choice should presumably be variable between, but not within males, thus potentially providing reliable cues of male identity and quality for prospecting females. In lekking species, sexual selection is usually intense, and females can freely choose mates. Studying the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a bird with an exploded lek mating system, we first identified male phenotypic traits that showed higher among, than within variation (plumage pattern, display rates and call structure). Among those and other traits (ornaments and their symmetry, body condition, lek spatial organization and territory quality), we identified phenotypic traits that correlated with male attractiveness toward females. At least four phenotypic male traits were correlated with female attraction, i.e. body condition, lek attendance, ornamental symmetry and display rates. Traits related to the initial female attraction on male territory seem to differ from traits related to the decision of females to stay in the territory of attractive males. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cereal pseudo-steppes hold the largest proportion of declining bird species in Europe. Understanding how this process of decline is driven is essential for designing adequate management practices. The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) is one of such threatened steppe-land bird species, which has suffered recent dramatic range constrictions and population declines. Although low breeding success has been claimed to be the main threat for the viability of future little bustard populations, the surprising lack of studies dealing with ecological requirements of broods hinders the implementation of efficient conservation practices. We studied the ranging behaviour and the reproductive success of a little bustard population by means of female radio-tracking conducted during 2006-2008 breeding seasons in the Ebro basin (NE Spain). We recorded an average breeding success of 0.27 chicks/hen, which is not enough to sustain a viable population according to the demographic models for the species. Early-laid clutches showed more probabilities to hatch and to fledge. This was associated to two different ranging patterns (i.e. sedentary versus wandering respectively) which depended on the ability of the hen and its chicks to settle in suitable areas harbouring enough arthropods and shelter for chicks. Such resources decrease drastically as the breeding season progresses. Overall, data suggest that agricultural practices associated to agricultural intensification, particularly early harvest, reduce breeding success both directly by nest destruction and indirectly through a decrease on resource availability for broods. Based on our findings on the characteristics and structure of the home range of little bustard broods, we propose the creation of a network of permanent vegetation plots interconnected by high-quality field margins as a management practice to raise the breeding success of little bustards and other ground-nesting birds on cereal farmland. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Collisions between birds and overhead power lines are an important cause of human-induced mortality. Mapping collision risk is an important prerequisite to minimise the negative impact of these structures on bird populations, particularly for species of high conservation concern and that are prone to collision. We mapped and modelled power line collision risk of a threatened and collision-prone species, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), based on three types of information: (i) the average daily distance flown by an individual, calculated from a satellite-telemetry study; (ii) the average percentage of flight movements at phase-conductor or shield-wire height, based on field focal observations; and (iii) a habitat suitability map for three different seasons (breeding, post-breeding and winter), modelled from an independent dataset of a nationwide population survey. An overall spatially explicit collision risk map was generated and validated with an independent mortality dataset derived from monitoring bird casualties in a sample of power lines. Collision risk of little bustards varied significantly both spatially and temporally. Compared to post-breeding and winter, little bustards moved smaller distances and flew at lower risk height during the breeding season, therefore minimising collision risk. The overall collision risk map contributed with relevant information to predict the likelihood of mortality events in a set of sampled power line sections. The described approach can be extended to transmission power lines, as well as to other bird species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A captive juvenile little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) was presented for acute onset of right head tilt and right circling. The bird failed to respond to supportive care and systemic antibiotic therapy. A bilateral granulomatous and fibrinoheterophilic otitis interna due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was diagnosed postmortem by histopathologic examination and bacterial culture. In bustards, Pseudomonas species have been documented in the normal bacterial flora of the oropharynx and are frequently reported in upper respiratory tract infections. This is the first report of a peripheral vestibular syndrome due to P aeruginosa otitis interna in a bustard species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be included as a possible cause of otitis and peripheral vestibular syndrome in bustards. © 2015 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

AB  - To document the population trend of the Little Bustard in north-west Africa, we performed an extensive literature review, and conducted six surveys in seven areas with potentially suitable habitat in north-western Morocco between 1999 and 2005. Both the number of birds and their distribution have apparently decreased, especially during the last third of the twentieth century. The present distribution is limited to the north-western part of Morocco, where at least five areas have been identified where Little Bustards have been sighted during the last years. The current population is extremely endangered, with an estimated total of not more than a few tens of birds. A detailed field survey is urgently needed to determine precisely numbers and distribution of the extant population in Morocco, as a first step to establish a conservation plan that aims to guarantee its survival in the future. © NISC Pty Ltd.

AB  - We investigated the ranging behaviour during the breeding season of 18 radiotracked little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) males, a disperse-lekking species inhabiting the cereal pseudo-steppes. The average kernel 95% home range was 60 ± 50. ha and the average cluster 85% area was 17 ± 17. ha. Range structure was as relevant as home range size for explaining the variation in the ranging behaviour of males, which could be partially explained by age, habitat quality and site. Ranging behaviour varied from males defending small and concentrated home ranges with high habitat quality, to males holding larger home ranges composed by several arenas. Our results suggest that social dominance and resource availability may affect ranging behaviour of males during the breeding season. Also, mating systems constraints may play a role on the use of space of males within the lekking ground. The ranging behaviour of a given male may be determined by a tendency to reduce and concentrate the home range as age and social status increase, and several fine-tuning mechanisms adjusting the ranging behaviour to the prevailing environmental or social factors on a given site and year. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax surveys were conducted in Iran in autumn and winter from 2005/2006 to 2008/2009. Across northern Iran, Little Bustard presence was confirmed at 15 of the 84 sites visited during the surveys. Three main wintering regions were identified: the Moghan Plain in the north-west of the country, the Turkmen Sahra Plain at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea and the Sarakhs Plain in the north-east, close to the Afghan border. Up to 10,050 individuals were counted in winter 2009 in the Moghan Plain, which was recognised as the most important area for wintering Little Bustards in Iran. The species was also found in good numbers in Miankaleh, Gomishan, Soufikam, Shour Lake and Sarakhs. Flocks comprising 51 to 500 individuals were the most commonly observed and represented 32% of occurrences. A marked increase in wintering population size was noted in recent years. The main wintering period in Iran extends from November to February. At a national scale, we estimated the Iranian wintering population of Little Bustards at 5,000-10,000 individuals. This preliminary assessment suggests the need for a nationwide survey, emphasising in particular the western, south-western and central parts of the country that were overlooked in our study. It suggests further that Little Bustards in Iran would greatly benefit from national and regional conservation programmes. © Copyright Â(c) BirdLife International 2012.

AB  - Hunting and its associated management have significant costs and benefits for biodiversity conservation, which makes this socio-economic activity highly controversial at both international and regional levels. We investigated relationships between management for small game species (mainly Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) and both abundance and richness of farmland and scrubland songbirds, raptors and ground-nesting birds, and on the abundance of three species of conservation concern (Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, Eurasian Thick-knee Burhinus oedicnemus and Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus) in southern Portugal farmland. We compared 12 game estates and 12 matching areas with similar sizes and land uses but no game management. Richness and abundance were estimated from fixed point counts, and were related to game regime (managed or unmanaged), habitat characteristics and census period. Our results showed that game management was associated, albeit weakly, with higher abundance of raptors and ground-nesting birds, but no relationship (either positive or negative) was found for other guilds and species. Habitat was generally the most important factor explaining bird species richness and abundance. Our results suggest possibilities for promoting management systems that could maximize both hunting sustainability and conservation value of managed areas, particularly when management helps to improve or maintain beneficial habitats or practices for farmland birds. © 2014 BirdLife International.

AB  - For the past 20 years, different policy and regulatory tools such as the agri-environment schemes (AES) and the Natura 2000 network have been used in Europe to halt the ongoing decline of farmland birds resulting from agricultural intensification. Despite their wide implementation, bird populations are still declining at national and European scales, thus questioning the effectiveness of these schemes. Here, we examined the impact of the designation in 2004 of a Special Protection Area (SPA) for the little bustard on the local trends of two non-targeted, common but declining farmland birds, the skylark and the corn bunting, in an intensive arable landscape of western France. From 1996 to 2012, trends in skylark presence or abundance decreased whereas trends in corn bunting abundance first decreased and then showed a recovery; the trends differed between outside and inside the SPA. Outside the SPA and consistently with trends at the national and European scales, skylark abundance sharply decreased whereas corn bunting abundance first decreased and then stabilized or even slightly increased. Within the SPA, the skylark declined less, and the corn bunting abundance increased at a faster rate than outside. Our results suggest that the implementation of a SPA in this arable landscape had a positive impact on these two farmland passerines, at least for corn buntings, for which the implementation of AES clearly improved habitat. Our results also suggest that the extensive implementation of SPAs may have had a positive impact on bird population trends in farmlands at a regional level, where c. 150000ha (15-20% of total arable landscape) have been designated since 2004. However, the SPA network (within Natura 2000) currently covers a mere 3.7% of French arable landscape, and it is therefore no surprise that specialist birds in farmland are still declining nationally. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - Abstract Migrating birds are known to avoid topographical barriers. At these barriers, the local environmental conditions often lead to a high concentration of migrants at certain corridors or points usually referred to as 'bottlenecks'. The Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea are such barriers for migrating birds in south-western Asia. A narrow coastal plain between the Greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan (Besh Barmag bottleneck) provides excellent conditions for studying bird migration of a poorly known region. Here, surveys were carried out in autumn 2011 and spring 2012 to count raptor, passerine and waterbird migration from three different observation points. Data for fixed block of six hours continual observations together with random counting hours have been interpolated by a special calculation to obtain estimated grand totals per species. In total, 278 bird species were recorded, eight of which are red-listed as globally threatened by the IUCN (i.e. Sociable Lapwing Vanellus gregarius, White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Saker Falcon Falco cherrug, Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Eastern Imperial Eagle Aquila heliaca, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga), another eight as 'near threatened'. Calculations indicated 1.24-1.51 million visible migrants in autumn 2011 and 0.65-0.82 million in spring 2012. For four species (Eurasian Skylark Alauda arvensis, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris, Rosy Starling Sturnus roseus, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax), the mean passage estimates exceeded 100,000 individuals. 15 species meet or are well within the range of the criterion of 1% of the world population. For a further 19 species they exceed the criterion of 1% of the flyway population. Dalmatian Pelican and Little Bustard were observed in great numbers representing 33-57% and 41-48% of the world population, respectively. Both species and, additionally, raptor and waterbird migration are discussed. The results presented here serve to underline the importance of Azerbaijan for migrating bird species in general, and to highlight in particular the great potential of the study area as a location for long-term monitoring studies in a remote and little-studied region.

AB  - Capturing wild animals for research or conservation purposes may cause some adverse effects, which is only acceptable if these are outweighed by conservation benefits. We used information from 3 on-going telemetry studies on the endangered little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) in Western Europe to evaluate the risk factors associated with capture and handling. Of 151 telemetered birds, 23 (15.2%) exhibited impaired mobility and coordination after release, probably related to the occurrence of capture myopathy. Among the 23 impaired birds, 10 (43.5%) died before recovering normal mobility (6.6% of all birds captured). Logistic regression analyses identified longer handling time, longer restraint time, use of cannon nets, and capture of juveniles as inducing factors for these disorders. We conclude that little bustard is fairly susceptible to suffering ataxia and paresia after release as a result of restraint associated with capture and manipulation. Researchers can reduce this risk by keeping handling and restraint time below 10-20 minutes, particularly when using cannon nets or when capturing juveniles.

AB  - Taxonomic classification of birds based exclusively on morphology and plumage traits has often been found to be inconsistent with true evolutionary history when tested with molecular phylogenies based on neutrally evolving markers. Here we present cytochrome-b gene sequences for the poorly known Little Brown Bustard Eupodotis humilis and analyse it in a phylogenetic context together with all other bustard species in the family Otididae. Our results suggest that this species is more closely related to the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax than to other members of the Eupodotis genus. This finding is consistent with previous results suggesting polyphyly in the genus Eupodotis and with the fact that many of the phenotypic traits used to classify members of the family Otiidae are not phylogenetically informative. © 2014 © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Summary. Traffic noise is an associated effect of roads, potentially impacting wildlife. In the case of birds, it may alter spatial distribution, behavioural responses and physiological status, frequently masking the acoustic signals of conspecifics and predators. We analyse how road traffic noise affects habitat selection of Little Bustard males during the breeding season, when they produce brief territorial snort calls. The study site is in a typical agrarian area in central Spain, markedly affected by traffic noise. A noise map was built using specific environmental noise modelling software. The habitat in the territories of 26 individually-recognisable males (62% of the male population in the study year) was characterised in relation to noise levels, agrarian substrate composition and distance to nearest males. Habitat selection models were performed using MaxEnt, and an averaged model of the first 20 significant ones was generated. The noise map revealed high noise pollution levels for the whole study area (range: 50.13-62.35 dB). Distance to the nearest male was the most important variable in habitat selection models, so that as distance increased suitability decreased, while the effect of traffic noise was nearly negligible. This lack of traffic noise effect on the habitat selection of Little Bustard males might be explained by the low overlap between their snort call frequency and that of traffic noise, but it also suggests a poor capacity by this bird to cope with recent, anthropogenic disturbance. In this respect, noisy but otherwise suitable habitats could be functioning as ecological traps for this rapidly declining species. -- Martínez-Marivela, I., Morales, M.B., Iglesias-Merchán, C., Delgado, M.P., Tarjuelo, R. & Traba, J.

AB  - This study analyses habitat selection by male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax of a central Spanish population within their display sites during two consecutive breeding seasons. The areas of sexual display sites were determined by applying minimum convex polygons (MCP) to locations of individual males throughout the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons. Habitat selection was addressed by means of a compositional analysis. The effects of variables related to phenology and to the density of conspecifics were examined, assuming an ideal free distribution of organisms. The spatial distribution of display areas was also analysed. During both years male Little Bustards showed a significant preference for old and same-year fallows, these offering both shelter and food. Contrary to what was expected, individuals did not select lower quality habitats when conspecific density increased or when areas were occupied earlier, suggesting that the population was not saturated. Display sites were not clumped, showing that in this population the Little Bustard may not employ a lek mating system, even though certain requirements of an exploded lek system - the inclusion in territories of particular habitat types that females could potentially use - were met. Our results emphasise the importance of agrarian substrates in determining occupation by this species, a finding with direct implications for the conservation of populations given that the agrarian landscape is on a sufficiently large scale for management measures to be introduced.

AB  - Hunting is one of the human activities that directly affect wildlife and has received increasing attention given its socioeconomic dimensions. Most studies have been conducted on coastal and wetland areas and showed that hunting activity can greatly affect bird behaviour and distribution. Hunting-free reserves for game species are zones where birds find an area of reduced disturbance. We evaluated the effect of hunting activities on the behaviour and use of hunting-free areas of lapwings Vanellus vanellus, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria and little bustards Tetrax tetrax in agricultural areas. We compared the habitat use and behaviour of birds on days before, during and after hunting took place. All three studied species showed strong behavioural responses to hunting activities. Hunting activity increased flight probability and time spent vigilant (higher on hunting days than just before and after a hunting day), to the detriment of resting. We also found distributional (use of hunting-free reserve) responses to hunting activities, with hunting-free reserves being used more frequently during hunting days. Thus, reserves can mitigate the disturbance caused by hunting activities, benefiting threatened species in agricultural areas. Increasing the size or number of hunting-free areas might be an important management and conservation tool to reduce the impacts of hunting activities. © Journal compilation © 2009 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - In lek mating systems, males defend small, clustered courts visited by females to mate (Höglund & Alatalo, 1995). Lekking species should meet four criteria proposed by Bradbury (1981): (1) there is no male parental care, so that males contribute nothing to the next generation apart from gametes; (2) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (3) the only resource females find at the lek are the males themselves, that is, male genes; (4) females can select their mate(s). However, many studies have shown the existence of mating systems that do not fit completely these conditions but that still should be considered as leks. Exploded leks (Gilliard, 1969; Emlen & Oring, 1977) form one of the main categories of such «non-classical» leks. In exploded leks, males displaying in the assemblage are considerably separated and aggregation is not detectable until they are mapped over a large area (Bradbury, 1981). As a consequence, males hold larger territories, and females can forage and even nest within them (Ligon, 1999), thus apparently failing to meet Bradbury’s third condition. Here, a review of some of the main issues related to exploded leks in birds are presented, emphasising the relevance of exploded leks in the study of lek evolution and female choice, given their features intermediate between classical leks and resource-based polygyny. The family of bustards, Otididae, is proposed as a suitable model for such studies, since different variants of exploded lekking have been described or proposed as the dominant mating system in many bustard species. The actual evidence on mating systems in this family is reviewed, especially regarding the better studied species, the Great Bustard Otis tarda and the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax. Finally, the importance of mating systems for the conservation biology of those and other exploded lekking species is discussed. © 2001 SEO/ Birdlife. All rights reserved.

AB  - The little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) has declined rapidly across European farmland landscapes due to agricultural intensification. In France, the number of breeding males in agricultural habitats has been reduced by 92% over the last 20 years as a result of decreases in insect abundance and nest destruction during harvesting. An age-and sex-structured stochastic metapopulation model was formulated for the remaining little bustard population in south-west France and, using actual estimates of demographic rates obtained after 1997, its extinction risk over the next 30 years was estimated to be ca. 0.48. Limited population reinforcement has thus appeared as a potential conservation strategy for this species in agricultural habitats, while agro-environmental actions have begun to have an effect on habitat quality at the landscape level. Different strategies for the reinforcement of fledglings, including the number and frequency of releases and the number of release localities in relation to four criteria for choosing the release points, were evaluated in terms of their effect in reducing the extinction risk of local populations and of the metapopulation. The reinforcement of 100 fledglings per year for 5 years and choosing the actual release points using the current abundance were found to be the optimal choices for reducing the estimated extinction risk of the remaining little bustard population in south-west France. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - This paper is a compilation of data about the distribution and relative abundance of the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax in the Iberian Peninsula, from a conservation point of view. Besides a comprehensive literature review, indices of relative abundance in 36 localities and absolute densities of breeding males in another 10 localities are presented. A detailed distribution map of the Little Bustard in the Iberian Peninsula is presented for the first time. Its population status differs considerably among regions: in the Southern Meseta, Extremadura and Alentejo the distribution is practically continuous, showing high densities (a guess of 170,000 breeding males is provisionally advanced for the Southern Meseta and Extremadura); whereas in the northern half of the Peninsula and most of Andalucia it is present in small areas and usually at very low densities, apparently having experienced important decreases. Increasing agricultural intensification seems to be responsible for the decline of the Little Bustard in the Iberian Peninsula, its main global stronghold.

AB  - Stochastic computer simulations are used to evaluate the sensitivity of Little bustard population parameters, estimating the survival probabilities of the seven endangered Little bustard populations of central-western France for which conservation actions are currentlybeing or have been implemented. Different scenarios of parameter compensation for those nuclei to establish parameter levels assuring population viability are discussed. Adult survival, productivity per female, initial population size and carrying capacity were the most sensitive parameters in a hypothetical, isolated population. Juvenile survival also affected population survival, although its sensitivity was lower. Sex ratio did not have a linear effect on population survival, but probability of extinction increased for extreme values. Productivity per female and initial population size, varied strongly among the populations studied, determining their average time of extinction and growth rate. When a metapopulation scenario was simulated, the survival probabilities of each population and the metapopulations stayed close to 1.0 if no mortality was associated to migration. When mortality during migration was included in the simulations, the metapopulation's probability of survival significantly decreased under 90%. This approach may help managers to correctly address conservation measures and design effective strategies, which should be directed mainly to improve productivity, enhance female survival, and minimise mortality during migration (e.g. promoting insect-rich nesting substrates, avoiding female killing and nest destruction at harvesting, reducing the risk of collision with powerlines, or controlling poaching). © Springer 2005.

AB  - Habitat selection of the little bustard Tetrax tetrax during the breeding season was analysed in four cultivated areas of Central Spain. Little bustards preferred long-fallow land, legume crops and fallow land. Cereal crops, ploughed land and shrubland were avoided. One of the most important habitat requirements was vegetation whose average height does not exceed 20 cm. The species shows some tolerance to the proximity of buildings, villages and roads. Conservation implications are discussed. © 1994.

AB  - In mosaic landscapes, patch use by animals may depend on features associated with neighbouring patches, e.g. resources or predators. This is of concern for species living in fragmented remnants of natural habitats surrounded by man-modified habitats. We studied how landscape context influenced habitat use by a lekking grassland bird, the little bustard, in a landscape where protected patches of natural steppe were interspersed with improved pastures suitable to bustards, and other unsuitable habitats. At a scale equivalent to a lekking site (30-70 ha), the abundance of displaying males and nesting females on steppe plots increased with increasing availability of improved pastures within 1 km of plots. This concentration of breeding bustards on steppe habitat around modified pastures may partly result from the species' lekking system. We emphasize that increasing the suitability of managed habitats around protected natural areas may help in maintaining viable populations of native species by providing additional resources or breeding sites. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - We examine the variability in phenotypic characteristics in Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax males to determine which are the elements that better allow individual recognition throughout a season. Six variables were chosen, for which individual variations could be classed into clearly distinguishable categories and for which all categories were well represented among the males present in our study population. These variables were: continuity of the white collar across the nape, colour pattern of the throat, symmetry of «V» white collar, the relative width of the black and white breast bands, the frequency of black dots on the mantle, and iris colour (Fig. 1). The combination of these six variables reliably allowed the individual recognition of all Little Bustard males (up to 55) in our study area throughout the breeding season at distances of up to 250 m with the aid of binoculars and telescopes. In areas where it is necessary to identify a much larger number of males, the addition of an extra variable would diminish the probability of two males having the same combination of variables. © 1999 SEO/ Birdlife.

AB  - The number of birds killed (per km) by collision with power lines in west-central Spain did not differ between one transmission line and two distribution lines. For all three power lines, we tested the ability of different markers to reduce bird collision by comparing marked spans to unmarked spans along the same power line. A spiral (30 cm × 100 cm) reduced collisions (static wire marking). Black crossed bands (35 cm × 5 cm) were also effective, but not for the vulnerable Great Bustard (Otis tarda) (conductor marking). The third marker, consisting of thin black stripes (70 cm × 0.8 cm), did not reduce mortality (conductor marking). The highest mortality from power-line collision was recorded for the Great and Little Bustard (Otis tarda and Otis tetrax).

AB  - In this study, a method based on plumage patterns and iris colour is used to identify individual male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax. High year-to-year repeatability of plumage patterns was proven for 10 colour-ringed males (over 80% of plumage criteria for individual males, with a mean repeatability of 93%). We thereafter assumed that highly consistent drawings made of birds in the same population in two successive years belonged to the same male. Applying this method in a population over three successive years revealed a small annual turnover of displaying males, with low adult male recruitment (17% and 19%), while about half the males (c. 45%) failed to return from one year to the other. Site fidelity for males was 57% and 53% in two successive years. We also found differences in phenotypic profile and biometrics between males of the sedentary population of southern France and males of the migratory populations of western France.

AB  - Four little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) (one adult and three juvenile males), captured with leg nooses and fitted with a backpack radiotag, died after capture. The first bird was found after 16 days with its left foot caught in the harness and died after 1 day. The other birds showed symptoms of capture myopathy after release, such as the difficulty or inability to fly and/or walk. They died after 5, 6, and 8 days, respectively. At necropsy, muscles affected in all cases were those from the legs, and these were diffusely pale and dull, with a soft friable texture. Microscopically these muscles had multiple foci of myofiber fragmentation, loss of striation, and necrosis; a mononuclear cell infiltrate was observed in muscle from two birds. These findings suggest the little bustard is susceptible to capture myopathy and that caution should be exercised during its capture and handling. © Wildlife Disease Association 2006.

AB  - Global climate change generated by human activities is likely to affect agroecosystems in several ways: reinforcing intensification in northern and western Europe, and extensification in the Mediterranean countries. If we are to predict the consequences of global warming for wildlife, distribution models have to include climate data. The METEOSAT temporal series from EWBMS offers an attractive alternative to using climatic surfaces derived from ground stations. The aim of this paper is to test whether this climatic satellite data can improve the distribution models obtained previously by Suárez-Seoane et al. using habitat variables for three agro-steppe bird species: great bustard, little bustard and calandra lark in Spain. Rainfall, radiation balance, evapotranspiration and soil moisture images were incorporated together with the other variables used as predictors in the published stepwise GAM models. Changes in the predicted distributions from the habitat only and climate-habitats models were assessed by reference to the CORINE land cover categories. Inclusion of climatic variables from METEOSAT led to statistically superior models for all three species. There were large differences in the climatic variables selected and the original variables dropped among the species. Evapotranspiration variables were the most frequently selected. Maps of the differences between the habitat and climate-habitat models showed very different patterns for the three species. Inclusion of climate variables led to a wider range of land cover types being deemed suitable. Despite the statistical superiority of models, care is needed in deciding whether to use climatic variables because they may emphasize the fundamental rather than the realized niche. Used together, however, habitat and climate models can provide new insights into factors limiting species distributions and how they may respond to climate change.

AB  - Four theoretical models have been proposed to account for the origin and maintenance of leks: hotspot, female preference, hotshot, and black hole models. Each has been validated in particular cases, and most are not mutually exclusive; therefore, it has been difficult to contrast and separate them, empirically and experimentally. By using decoys to mimic natural leks in the little bustard, artificial leks attracted wild birds. Then, by manipulating artificial lek size and structure (sex ratio, male phenotype), the study of responses of wild males and females allowed us to test specific predictions derived from the four classical models of lek evolution. The hotspot model was not supported because female decoys did not attract wild males. Conversely, hotshot males do exist in this species (attracting both wild females and males), as does a female preference for a particular lek size (four males). Finally, males aggressive toward decoys attracted fewer females, consistent with one of the mechanisms by which the black hole model may work. Therefore, three models of lek evolution were partly or fully supported by our experimental results: hotshot, female preference, and black hole models. We suggest that these models actually fit within each other, ensuring the evolution, functioning, and long-term maintenance of leks. © 2006 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims To determine which arthropod orders contributed most during the laying–rearing period and those important in determining breeding success of the species in an intensive agricultural habitat. Methods Faeces (n = 388, 345 g) and three gut samples were dissected to determine which arthropod orders contributed most to the diet, especially during the laying–rearing period. Results Coleoptera were the most numerous prey followed by Orthoptera, Dermaptera and Hymenoptera. No difference was observed in the diet of adult males and females. Although adults ate arthropods throughout the breeding season, plant material contributed 97–99% of faecal contents by weight in each month. Chicks, however, only ate arthropods, notably Coleoptera and Orthoptera, at least until 2–3 weeks old. Conclusion Increasing arthropod availability would be a useful management tool for maintaining endangered Little Bustard populations by potentially increasing chick survival. © 2002 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - In lekking species, female choice of particular males for mating is based on male characters that are not related to immediate gains such as access to resources. This is, however, unclear in exploded-lekking species, as male territories may contain resources for females; it is thus the degree to which males regulate female access to these resources to obtain matings that should distinguish lekking from nonlekking species. We investigated the relationship between resources for females, male distribution and male attractiveness in little bustards. One parameter determining resource quality for females was invertebrate availability: females laid eggs in grassland fields (grass, alfalfa and ryegrass) with significantly higher invertebrate biomass than others of similar cover but nests were in areas that did not have higher invertebrate biomass, at a scale of 1 km2. Males set up territories and females laid eggs in areas that had a high proportion of alfalfa, but not high mean invertebrate biomass. Thus males set up territories at resources potentially used by females, but that appeared not to be critical for breeding. In addition, females did not use the amount of resources defended as a criterion for mate choice, as male attractiveness was not related to various territorial resources. Locating the lek in areas attractive to females might be a way of increasing the probability of encounter between the sexes. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - This study examined the multi-scale effects of farmland management on the assemblages of grassland wintering birds in Southern Portugal, evaluating the potential influences on bird conservation of ongoing transformations in agricultural landscapes. The bird assemblages of 42 grassland fields were characterised and related to three sets of variables reflecting field management, landscape context and large-scale spatial trends. Birds showed responses to the three sets of variables, with variation partitioning indicating that species richness was primarily influenced by landscape context, whereas abundances were mostly determined by field management. In general, high species richness was associated with small patches of arable land, diverse landscapes, high stream density and forest and shrub cover, which probably acted as sources of non-agricultural species to grassland fields. In contrast, fields located in homogenous arable landscapes tended to be species poor, though they were the most favourable for open farmland species of conservation concern (e.g. skylark, calandra lark and little bustard). Old grazed fallows were generally associated with the highest abundances of both invertebrate and seed-eating birds, particularly that of winter visitors. Seed-eating winter visitors were also associated with stubble fields. The results indicated that conservation of Iberian grasslands for wintering birds requires management at both the landscape and field scales. At the landscape level, large blocks of open farmland habitat need to be maintained. At the field level, conservation management should strive to maintain both stubble fields and old grazed fallows. The application of such prescriptions would require a combination of agri-environmental programs and land planning policies, whereby the financial support to individual farmers should be conditional on the maintenance of adequate landscape contexts at larger spatial scales. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Populations of Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) have shown pronounced declines in European farmland landscapes over the last 25 years due to the intensification of agricultural practices. In France, the number of breeding males in agricultural habitats has declined by 92% since 1980 as a result of decreases in insect abundance and nest destruction during harvesting. We formulate an age- and sex-structured stochastic model for the remaining Little Bustard population in SW France that has been studied since 1997 and, using actual values of demographic rates, we estimate its extinction risk over a time period of 30 years to be of 0.45. At the level of local populations, the extinction risk ranged between 0.66 and 0.90, largely depending on the initial population size and local fecundity of each population. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis evaluated the influence of uncertain demographic rates and of aspects of the spatial dynamics (sex and age dispersing individuals, sex-biased dispersal and different dispersal rates) on the predicted extinction risks and showed that our model was robust to changes of a wide range of combinations assessed. Given the severity of the current decline, and the spatial issues raised by our analysis, implications of our findings for the conservation of this endangered species are suggested. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  -                              Aims: The Little Bustard often occurs in fragmented open landscapes in southwest Portugal, where agricultural fields are spaced with forest stands and shrublands. In these areas species abundances and distribution patterns are poorly known, and there is almost no information about the effects of human activities on the species. In this study we present the first results on the distribution and abundances, as well as macro-habitat modelling for Little Bustard displaying males. Location: Site of Community Importance of Cabrela, an area included in the national list of sites 'Natura 2000'. Alto Alentejo, southwest Portugal. Methods: Combining field data (displaying males distribution), GIS techniques and spatial analysis such as Ordinary Kriging, predictive models were computed for the occurrence of the Little Bustard during the breeding season. Results: Results indicate a total of 72 displaying males and an average breeding density of 0.7 displaying males' km                             .2                             . Logistic regressions suggest a slight tendency for the selection of the inner part of the larger patches of potential habitat. Variables related with soil constraints are likely to be important. The interpolated Ordinary Kriging models indicate a good agreement with the field data. Conclusions: Ordinary Kriging models can be very helpful for modelling distributions in highly fragmented landscapes and as a tool for the management of the species habitat by potentially predicting the impacts derived from human actions at landscape level.

AB  - The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is one of the most endangered species in Europe. The French populations breeding in cultivated areas have suffered a drastic decline during the last 20 years and have disappeared from several locations. In a political context, where management agreements are developed under EU agri-environment regulations, it has become urgent to identify the ecological requirements of this species, to predict its response to environmental changes and to suggest management tools, such as promotion of beneficial farming practices. Despite the fact that many studies have described the habitat of the Little Bustard, quantitative data are lacking. We measured habitat use in relation to availability in a cultivated plain in western France in 1995. Habitat use by the Little Bustard differed significantly from habitat availability. Some crops, such as oilseed rape and cereals, were avoided. Sunflower crops were used by Little Bustard males, but were avoided by females. Females used set-aside to a greater extent than males. Habitat diversity was significantly greater around the centre of male activity than in randomly selected areas. These differences were found for areas within a radius of 100 and 200 m around centres of male activity but not for those with a 300 m radius. Vegetation height was one of the most important variables for calling males, as low vegetation is needed to detect and be detected by conspecifics. The most important variables for females are food resources and, to a lesser extent, predator avoidance. For these reasons, recent changes in land use on arable plains are likely to have different effects on males and females. Conservation measures should take into account these differences, the importance of the scale of measurement and should incorporate specific ecological requirements. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - 1. Predictive models of species' distributions are used increasingly in ecological studies investigating features as varied as biodiversity, habitat selection and interspecific competition. In a pilot study, we based a successful model for the great bustard Otis tarda on advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, which offer attractive predictor variables because of the global coverage, high temporal frequency of overpasses and low cost. We wished to assess whether the approach could be applied at very large spatial scales, and whether the coarse resolution of the imagery (1 km2) would limit application to those bird species with large home ranges or to simple recognition of broad habitat types. 2. We modelled the distributions of three agricultural steppe birds over the whole of Spain using a common set of predictor variables, including AVHRR imagery. The species, great bustard, little bustard Tetrax tetrax and calandra lark Melanocorhypha calandra, have similar habitat requirements but differently sized home ranges, and are all species of conservation concern. Good models would reveal differences in distribution between the species and have high predictive power despite the large geographical extent covered. 3. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were built with the presence-absence of the species as the response variable. Individual species' responses to the habitat variables were identified using partial fits and compared with each other. We found that this modelling framework could successfully distinguish the habitats selected by the three species, while the response curves indicated how the habitats differed. Model fits and cross-validations assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots showed the models to be successful and robust. 4. We overlaid the predictive maps to identify key areas for agricultural steppe birds in Spain and compared these with the present network of protected sites in two sample regions. In Castilla León the provision of protected sites appears appropriate, but in Castilla La Mancha large areas of apparently suitable habitat have no protection. 5. These results confirm that large-scale models are able to increase our understanding of species' ecology and provide data for conservation planning. AVHRR imagery, in combination with other variables, has sufficient resolution to model a range of bird species, and GAMs have the flexibility to model subtle species-habitat responses.

AB  - We studied variables affecting spatial and inter-annual variations in presence/absence and abundance of little bustard (Tetrax tetrax) males in extensive cereal farmland in central Spain. Both variables were positively influenced by the percentage of arable surface and also by substrate heterogeneity. In addition, male abundance varied significantly between years and among sectors of the study area, even when taking into account variation in landscape variables. A significant interaction between year and sector showed that abundance variations did not follow a fixed pattern, meaning that interannual variation in male abundance among sectors cannot be predicted. We discuss potential alternatives to explain such variation, as well as the implications of our results for the species' population estimates, status assessment and conservation. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - Twenty years of implementing the bird directive in France. Status of Annex 1 breeding species in the SPAs and proposals for new designations. 117 Special protection Areas (SPAs) have been designated in France since the Birds Directive (EC 79/409) came into action in 1981. The total area covered by SPAs is 835,700 ha, or 1.5% of metropolitan national territory and cover 18% of the total IBAs area. Analyses have been conducted in order to quantify how representative SPAs are for protected and threatened species at the national level. Out of 125 Annex 1 species breeding in France (protected in the EU), 85 are present in the 117 SPAs, but only 18 of them (14.4%) have significant breeding population within SPAs (i.e. >50% of the national population). For each site, an "Avifauna Index" (lo) was calculated, based on the numbers of protected or threatened species present and the proportion of the national population of each species at the site in order to evaluate whether the designation process did concentrate on priority sites. Results showed that on average, SPAs have a higher avifauna index than IBAs without SPA. Therefore, while few areas and few species are properly protected by SPAs, a good proportion of the best IBAs have been designated, but most of them only partially. A method for new designations is proposed, which selects IBAs with higher avifauna index and low proportion of designated area as SPA. A further analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of the designation of 30 proposed priority IBAs on the conservation of threatened species. This approach indicates that the 'Avifauna index' of the SPA network could easily be doubled by the designation of a few sites.

AB  - Fallow fields represent a large proportion of cereal steppes in southern Portugal. A study of the bird populations using fallows in the Castro Verde region during the breeding season was made during spring 1996, with the objective of characterizing the bird community and describing relationships between bird density and vegetation structure, for selected species. For each of 50 transects, birds were counted once and variables related to vegetation structure were measured. Multivariate analyses were used to explore the relationships between bird density and habitat characteristics. The bird community of fallows was characterized by the numerical abundance of two species ? Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra (8.5 birds/km) and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax (4.5 birds/km) ? which represented 60% of the total number of birds detected. Of the 28 bird species observed, only four others reached average relative densities greater than 1 bird/km: Great Bustard Otis tarda, Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra and Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla. The variables influencing bird density were related mainly to vegetation height, cover by bare ground and presence of shrubs. The results suggest that agricultural management practices which promote the simultaneous presence of fallows with different habitat characteristics will increase species diversity at the local level. The models built were also used to predict changes in bird populations as a consequence of changes in grazing intensity and land abandonment. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Galician population of Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax occupies a marginal area within the Iberian distribution range of the species, and up to the present day it has received little attention. The general pattern of habitat selection of territorial males in the A Limia region (Galicia, NW Spain) between the years 2003 and 2004 has been studied, through the development of generalised linear models, which analised the characteristics of circular surfaces delimited by radii of 100 and 250 metres around the places with (n = 18) and without (n = 36) Little Bustards. In the central surfaces of the territories there is less potato crop and greater surfaces of semipermanent crops, whereas in the circles with a 250 metres radius there is also greater surfaces of semipermanent crops. The species avoids the presence of roads and agricultural tracks.

AB  - Counts of breeding birds in fallow land of Castro Verde region, the main steppe area of Portugal, were carried out during the spring of 1994, and the population densities of the most common species were estimated. The bird community is relatively simple, with a low species richness and diversity. Nevertheless, it includes several species with unfavourable conservation status. The most common species were Calandra Lark Melnocorypha calandra and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, with a mean density of, respectively, 5.6 and 2.6 males/10 ha. Other breeding species in the studied fallows include Great Bustard Otis tarda, Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra, Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, Little Owl Athene noctua, Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemns, Quail Coturnix coturnix and Fan-tailed Warbler Cisticola juncidis. The results suggest that there are differences in population densities in fallows of different age and grazing intensity.

AB  - Breeding avifauna of the Causse Méjean (Lozère, France) is known since the end of 19th century thanks to several publications; these permit us to know its composition and to specify the status of many species. This paper brings additional information on the habitat and curent abundance of 55 species mostly related to open grasslands and scrub habitats. Basic parameters on birds and their habitats obtained from 150 points counts carried out by means of Frequential Sampling (EFP) have been submitted to a Correspondence Analysis with respect to Instrumental Variables (AFC-VI). The results of this Multivariate Analysis allow us to define 6 groups of species representative of the various sampled formations and to characterize the habitat they occupy within the studied gradient of vegetation structure which stretches from open grassland to forest. The composition of the breeding avifauna of the three most important formations, i.e. grassland (16 species), shrubland (32 species), and pine forest (31 species) is drawn up and their patrimonial value analysed using the criteria retained by Rocamora & Yeatman-Berthelot (1999). This analysis reveals that grasslands with 14 patrimonial species and shrublands with 18 species have a stronger patrimonial interest than pine forest (only one species). A comparison of the current and past composition of the Causse Méjean's bird communities is carried out thanks to both published and unpublished previous data. Phenomena of extinction for 3 species (Grey Partridge Perdrix perdrix, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, and Woodchat Shrike Lanius senator) as well as expansion and colonization for 6 others species (e.g. Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus, Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto, and Starling Sturnus vulgaris) are highlighted and commented on. Finally the future of the Causse's avifauna is discussed following the large Pinus nigra plantations of the first half of 20th century and in relation with the recent evolution of stock farming practices. These provoke a regression of the open lawn grasslands previously maintained by an adequate sheep grazing pressure. Thus, more than 5,600 ha of grasslands have disappeared between 1948 and 1989 from the eastern part of Causse Méjean (naked Causse) in favour of shrublands and forests.

AB  - More than half of the world's population of the little bastard Tetrax tetrax lives in the Iberian Peninsula, where it is mostly dependent for survival on extensive agricultural areas. The species has declined dramatically, chiefly due to changes in agricultural practices, and is now globally 'Near Threatened'. Knowledge of its habitat requirements is crucial to reverse the trend of habitat deterioration. Winter habitat preferences were studied in a region dominated by extensive cereal farming in Southern Portugal, comparing the characteristics of sites used by 54 flocks with those of randomly selected sites within the study area. The birds preferred recent fallows and grassy vegetation of mid-size (about 11-20 cm) and mid-density (about 11-50% cover). They tended to concentrate on the tops of hills and to avoid disturbed areas near roads and houses. Overall, the observed preferences suggest that predator avoidance is a significant factor in habitat selection. To improve habitat suitability for little bustard, managers of key wintering areas should minimize permanent sources of human disturbance, encourage rotations with frequent fallows, and favour moderate levels of grazing to manipulate vegetation height and cover. Particular attention should be given to the upper parts of the hills. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - From 1980 to 1984 studies were made of the agonistic, territorial and courtship behaviour of the Little Bustard in Southern France and Portugal. The behaviour patterns are described in detail, the signals involved are analysed, and factors which could have led to their evolution are discussed. In the reproductive period agonistic encounters between males happen remarkably often. Aggressive excitement is expressed in both sexes by compression of the neck-feathers and stretching of the neck, and in the female by the erection and lateral folding of the tail-feathers. There are several kinds of threat behaviour in territorial encounters: running or flying towards intruders; lateral threat behaviour (if both males are of similar strength); and bill-fighting which only occurs if aggressive behaviour of a lower intensity has not led to the submission of one of the rivals. Calling is a territorial behaviour and serves to mark a territory. The frequency of calls is not affected by the presence of females, but the presence of other males close to the territory borders can result in a marked increase in calling frequency. In addition to the acoustic signal, the call involves a sharp neck-jerk which may act as an optical signal, at least over short distances. In flight males produce a whistling sound by means of the specially adapted 7th primary feather on their wings. This sound has important meaning in intraspecific communication during the reproductive period: it announces a flying male to other males as well as to females, and causes territorial and aggressive behaviour, or fleeing of these birds. The flight sound is also an important element of the behaviour patterns "territorial wingbeat display" and "jumping display". Within their territories males always fly with the neck raised at a slight angle and with suppressed, shallow wing-beats. Two interpretations of this flight are discussed: that it serves to advertise the conspicuously coloured neck-feathers in a display; or that it is a search flight for locating and chasing-off intruders. "Territorial wingbeat display" begins with an accelerating foot-stamping and leads into a call. During the call the male performs three very fast, whistling wing-beats but remains on the ground. The combined elements, foot-stamping, calling and whistling wings, produce a unique and distinctive acoustic signal. The foot-stamping is only performed at special display sites where the sound is amplified by the substrate structure. At such sites, the soil typically has trapped pockets of air below a compacted surface which may result from the repeated defecating and stamping of the male on the same spot. Territorial wingbeat display behaviour is only performed for short periods in low light intensities at dawn and dusk. The presence of females has no effect on the intensity of the behaviour which serves a territorial function. It is interpreted to be a ritualisation of the aggressive running or flying of a territorial male towards an intruder. Optical elements of this behaviour cannot have much importance because the body and wings of the bird are rarely visible above the vegetation. Territorial wingbeat display behaviour cannot be seen over long distances and from this reason cannot serve to attract females into a males territory. "Jumping display" is only performed at much higher light intensities than territorial wingbeat display so the two never occur at the same time of day. The intensity of the behaviour increases markedly in the presence of females in sharp contrast to the territorial wingbeat display. The jumping display is performed in a similar way to the territorial wingbeat display except that the foot-stamping is much less intensive, the wing-beats are slower, and the bird jumps off the ground during the wing-beats. During the jumping display the black and white patterns on the body and wings are clearly visible and the behaviour increases the conspicuousness of the male markedly. The jump, advertising the wing-pattern up to a height of 65 cm, together with the specific location of the display site, ensures that maximum visibility of the male above the vegetation is achieved at minimum energetic cost. Activities of the females and their interactions with males during the jumping periods indicate that this behaviour serves to attract females to the males territory. The "chasing of females" is also a courtship behaviour and serves in stimulating and preparing females for copulation. In a characteristic posture with the head retracted into the neck-collar, the male rapidly runs behind the female, repeatedly stopping abruptly and calling whilst throwing its head and body sideways. Copulations are performed very quickly and only happen after a female has been chased for some time. Under certain preconditions chasing suppresses the aggressive and defence behaviour of the female which normally characterises encounters with males, and thus leads to readiness for copulation. Copulation itself removes this effect and after only one or two seconds aggression leads to the escape of the female. © 1986 Verlag der Deutschen Ornithologen-Gesellschaft.

AB  - We analysed the display behaviour of male little bustard Tetrax tetrax to identify displays that are used in the context of male-male competition and those that are used for attracting females. Courtship was the main activity of males during the breeding season. Calling activity occurred throughout the day, and leks were attended for more than 4 months. Male sexual displays included snort call, wing-flash, and jump display. Snort call was performed throughout the day and mainly involved male-male interactions. In contrast, the wing-flash display was given only at twilight, and was performed most commonly when a female was present, supporting an inter-sexual function for this display. The jump display was performed only in the presence of female at anytime of the day. Analysis of individual variations in display behaviour revealed that intra-individual variation was low compared to inter-individual variation, especially for the jump display. It is, therefore, possible that display rates provide information on male quality. Four male settlement patterns could be defined, singles, paired, lekking and satellite lekking, but only wing-flash display and stamped snort call differed among those categories. We suggest that satellite males are attempting to benefit from proximity to higher status males, in accordance with the hotshot hypothesis of lek evolution. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Leks have recently been defined as male display aggregations that females attend primarily for the purpose of mating. This is an extended version of previous definitions, as a clear-cut definition of leks is difficult to obtain. Four criteria should be verified to identify a lekking species: (I) there is no male parental investment beyond the sperm; (ii) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (iii) the only resource females find on the lek is the male, i.e. the male genes; (iv) females can select her mate(s), although the necessity of this latter condition for lekking species has been highly debated. We applied these criteria to the endangered little bustard Tetrax tetrax, a species that is claimed to show an exploded lek mating system, but for which this has never been fully investigated. We monitored a population of little bustards in western France during 2 years to investigate the two central criteria in the assessment of their mating system: Male aggregation in arenas and lack of consistent resources in male territories. We analysed the spatial distribution of little bustard male territories, the individual variation in size, and the land use characteristics of male territories, with particular attention to the habitats that may be considered as defensible resources. Displaying males showed an aggregated spatial distribution over the study area during the 2 years of survey. Male territories were rather large (19±16 ha), but a large among-male variability in territory size was observed. Land use within the territories included mainly permanent and semi-permanent crops. The variability in land use among territories suggests also that resources found within male territories were selected according to male needs (food and display) rather than to female needs (permanent crops that are more appropriate for reproduction). The mating system of the little bustard seems to match the general (and extended) definition of leks, at least in some populations. However, limits between resource defence polygyny and extreme exploded or resource-based leks are thin and unclear, and the little bustard is a good example of how lek definitions may be difficult to apply in non clear-cut empirical situations. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We review the main studies on habitat selection at the scale of agrarian substrate by two non-passerine birds typical of Iberian and Mediterranean cereal farmland, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax and the Great Bustard Otis tarda. For each species and at each study site, we analyse the influence of landscape composition and degree of agrarian intensification on population density and pattern of agrarian substrate selection. Neither landscape composition nor intensification level showed any significant effect on population density, although landscape diversity was positively co-related with little bustard population density. The pattern of agrarian substrate selection was unaffected by landscape composition or agrarian intensification in either species, while the type of substrate itself was the only variable affecting such pattern in both of them. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of both species.

AB  - 1. The little bustard Tetrax tetrax is among many birds thought to be declining because of agricultural intensification in western Europe. In contrast with the situation elsewhere, bustard numbers have greatly increased during the last 50 years in the Crau, southern France, as agriculture has been developing. We wished to ascertain which features of agricultural development might have supported this population increase. 2. Using data on habitat-specific densities obtained by surveys of the Crau in 1998 and 1999, we assessed how breeding male little bustards used habitats representing various levels of agricultural intensification. We also documented historical changes in bustard numbers and agricultural trends in the Crau, comparing them with present patterns of habitat use, to determine how changes in farmed landscapes may have driven population trends. 3. Male bustards used natural steppe and extensive agricultural habitats (fallow, grazed crops, legume crops), whereas more intensive agricultural habitats (hay-meadows, grain crops) were little used. Mean densities on extensive agricultural habitats were always high, but densities on steppe varied with landscape composition: densities were low where steppe was dominant in the landscape, but high where steppe and extensive agriculture were mixed. 4. Available literature showed that little bustards settled in the Crau around 1950, after 40% of the original steppe had been converted into arable land. We estimate a current population of 473-539 breeding males. Only 17% of the original steppe remains, but extensive agricultural habitats still represent 30% of arable land. 5. Both historical data and present habitat use suggest that little bustard population trends in the Crau are driven by the development of extensive agriculture. Extensive agricultural habitats may provide little bustards with resources unavailable or scarce in natural steppe. Severe declines in little bustard numbers observed elsewhere could be reversed within a few decades by restoring extensive agricultural habitats. The potential impact of current European agricultural policies is discussed, with special reference to agri-environmental measures and set-aside policy. 6. This work provides an example of an avian species that benefits from cultivated landscapes, providing that they are extensive rather than intensive. We propose a simple conceptual model to illustrate how little bustards, and possibly grassland birds in general, might respond where natural habitats are modified along orthogonal axes representing cultivation and agricultural intensification.

AB  - The first proof of reproduction of little bustard in Provence and the Gard dates from the beginning of this century. Before then it was a rare wintering species. Increased cultivation in the Crau has allowed it to increase considerably, so that it is now common in the area. Some 423-470 singing males were estimated on the Crau. Twenty or so other centres of population occur elsewhere in Provence, accounting for 90-100 individuals. Winter counts in the Crau, the only wintering site in the study area, showed there to be maxima of 900-1300 birds, 1972-1984, one of the highest concentrations of the species in the world.-from English summary

AB  - The Ag-Gel in the south of the Azerbaijani Kura-Araz depression is a shallow, saline steppe lake. Steppe and semi dessert vegetation and dry scrubland surround the expansive water surface and huge reedbeds of the central part. Many globally threatened bird species use the Ag-Gel as breeding and wintering habitat. Data from the few literature show that the Ag-Gel region is an enormous important breeding, resting and wintering site for entire populations of several bird species. This can be seen by globally threatened species like Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax), White-headed Duck (Oxyura leucocephala) and Lesser White-fronted Goose (Anser erythropus) being present in high numbers. Besides nine species of herons some thousand pairs of Pygmy Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus) are also breeding in the reedbeds. Although the whole lake area and the surroundings became a Nationalpark in 2003, this status has not been fulfilled yet, caused by present hunting and fishing activities as well as agricultural influences. Within a practical training in the course biology at the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University Greifswald we had, by means of the Michael Succow Foundation and by invitation of the Ministry for Ecology and Natural Resources of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the opportunity to implement the first scientific bird ringing since the independence of the country in 1991. New knowledge about the little known songbirds was acquired. Waterbirds and other species were recorded and the conservation situation was observed.

AB  - Based on the concept of an ecological niche, the processes of segregation in the Lower Volga populations of great and little bustards (Otis tarda L. and Tetrax tetrax L). have been studied in the evolutionary and adaptive aspects. The results have shown that segregation of the ecological niches of the two species occurs mainly on a trophic basis, when bird specialization in the use of food resources provides the possibility of changing the nesting biotopes. Some trophic adaptations are temporary and do not modify a species-specific stereotype, whereas other adaptations lead to the development of new forms of behavior and their evolutionary stabilization. Spatial characteristics (biotopic preference, nest location, etc.) complement the identified hierarchical series of parameters characterizing the ecological niches of the species studied. In the Transvolga region of Saratov oblast, the total sizes of great and little bustard populations in the breeding season reach approximately 4100 and 5900 birds, respectively.

AB  - Research conducted in several Mediterranean areas indicates that most populations of steppe birds are currently experiencing population declines associated with intensification of traditional agricultural practices. By using habitat suitability modeling (HSM), our aim was to use available environmental data sets, including land use and relief, to model the current distribution of nine steppe bird species in the agriculture dominated areas of the Catalan Ebro basin (northeast Iberia). We then employ HSM to quantitatively assess the future impact of land use changes on the potential distribution range of these species under two scenarios following irrigation of present extensive cereal steppes in the area. HSM analyses showed a close association between steppe bird distribution and the extent of extensive cereal agriculture in flat areas. Although the sensitivity to planned irrigation schemes was species specific, we estimated significant decreases in distribution after irrigation for seven of the nine species examined, i.e. the Little bustard, the Montagu's harrier, the Roller and the Calandra lark, the species predicted to be more severely affected by predicted decreases in area exceeding 50%. Overall, core steppe habitats where most valuable steppe species may co-occur are expected to be mostly impacted and decrease by 74 to 81% after irrigation of only 28 to 36% of the cereal cropland in the region. Future maintenance and survival of viable populations of steppe birds will rely on our ability to enlarge the network of protected areas and to implement agri-environmental measures targeting current species core habitats in low-intensity farmland.
